On the other hand, the demand for water is increasing mainly due to urbanisation and industralisation. He expressed concern over uneven distribution of water both in space and time. Nation is to face the challenging task ahead as water has become a scarce commodity. He stressed the need for revolving strategy for development and management of water resources in the country. The development of water resources requires an integrated approach as optimal utilisation is the need of the hour. At the same time, he laid emphasis on improvement of efficiency in the system and sought active participation of all sections of the society to meet the challenges of the future. The National Water Policy 2002 provides for participatory approach to water resources management and to involve stakeholders in an effective and decisive manner in various aspects of planning, development and management of water resources schemes. As the ground water resources is fast depleting due to overexploitation for irrigation and industries, the quality of water has been adversely affected, he said. It is, therefore, necessary to manage the extraction of groundwater in efficient and sustainable manner. To meet the objective of sustainable development, the strategy has to focus on augmentation of available water resources, their optimal utilisation and without sacrificing its quality. For recycling and use of treated effluents, adoption of traditional techniques are to be adopted and promoted where ever feasible for conservation of water resources.

The case has been already handed over to the CBI. Those responsible for his death, wherever they may be, will not be spared. I also send my condolences to the bereaved family. The National Highway project is a great dream not merely for me but for the entire nation. Thanks to the efforts of talented engineers like Dubey, it has made remarkable progress already and my government is committed to ensuring that those working on it complete it without any fear. The outpouring of sympathy for Dubey from across the world shows that Indians, wherever they are have a commitment to honesty and transparency and a significant stake in the country’s future. The government shares that commitment and appreciates their concern. I was recently at IIT Kanpur, the institute where Satyendra Dubey got his education. It was inspiring to see the talent, sense of hope and commitment among the students and the faculty. We can’t let criminals or vested interests weaken that spirit""."
86,10-December-2003 11:16 IST,Prime Minister's Office,INDIA-GHANA KOFI ANNAN CENTRE OF EXCELLENCE FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND I.T. INAUGURATED PRIME MINISTER’S REMARKS,"The Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee participated in the inaugural function of Indian-Ghana Kofi Annan Centre of Excellence for Communications and Information Technology, through video-conferencing, at his residence, yesterday. Following is the full text of the remarks by the Prime Minister on the occasion: ""It is a great pleasure to participate at this inaugural function. I would have loved to be with all of you in Accra today. When I met President Kufour on Friday, I explained to him why I had to return home from Abuja, without going through with my scheduled visit to Ghana. From another perspective, it is perhaps fitting that this Centre should be inaugurated through this inter-continental connection, illustrating the power and versatility we have today achieved in information and communications technologies. It is also apt that this Centre is named after UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, who is a great son of Ghana and a distinguished citizen of Africa. It was his original idea to set up such an institution of empowerment in Ghana, to serve the entire West African region. It was only over a year ago, during President Kufuor’s landmark visit to India, that we signed an Agreement on cooperation in Information Technology. The remarkable speed with which this centre has been completed is a tribute to President Kufuor’s personal interest in the project and the dedication of the project team. This institution is a symbol of the strong and enduring partnership between India and Ghana. It is a partnership forged during our struggle for independence, cemented during our joint campaign against colonialism and apartheid, and sustained by our shared aspirations for democracy and development. On this auspicious occasion, I reiterate India’s desire to further enrich this relationship by strengthening and diversifying our bilateral cooperation in mutually beneficial directions. Capacity building is an important catalyst of the development process. This institute will develop capacity in an area of technology, which is central to today’s knowledge economy. The world market for IT products this year is estimated at 3 Trillion dollars, marking a growth of 20 per cent over last year. This market will grow exponentially in the years to come. India’s IT exports crossed 10 billion dollars this year, and we hope to raise this figure to 50 billion dollars by 2008. Many factors contributing to our success also exist in Ghana. You have a high quality education system, a young English-speaking work force and a strengthening telecommunications infrastructure. This Centre can help Ghana increase its presence in the global IT market. India is equally committed to human resource development in other fields in Ghana. Thousands of students from Ghana have, over the years, studied in Indian training centres or institutions of higher education. We would welcome more. Under our international technical and economic cooperation programme, 30 seats are allotted annually in Indian institutions to Ghanaian students and professionals for training in a variety of scientific, technical, economic, commercial, management and other disciplines. In response to increased demand, we have now decided to double this figure to 60. India also offers five scholarships annually to students from Ghana, who may wish to study in Indian universities. We are progressing in other areas of development cooperation. Small and medium enterprises, agriculture, irrigation, pharmaceuticals and telecommunications are promising areas. We have already extended a line of credit of 15 million dollars for mutually identified projects. We can extend its scope to include purchases of equipment. We are finalizing arrangements for further enhancing the quantum of this credit. There are many more vistas of India-Ghana cooperation yet to be opened. Our bilateral efforts are directed towards exploring them. I take this opportunity send my greetings to the community of Indian origin in Ghana. Like other members of the 20 million strong Indian Diaspora abroad, they have become productive citizens of their country of domicile, politically and economically integrated in their adopted homeland, while retaining their cultural affinities with the country of their origin. In conclusion, I wish this India-Ghana Kofi Annan Centre of Excellence for Information and Communications Technology every success. I look forward to seeing it, when I fulfil my commitment to visit Ghana. Long live India-Ghana friendship."""

96,10-December-2003 16:37 IST,Ministry of Environment and Forests,ENVIRONMENT MINISTER LEAVES FOR MILAN TO TAKE PART IN CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE,"The Minister for Environment and Forests, Shri T.R.Baalu left New Delhi for Italy this morning to take part in the high level segment of the Conference of Parties (COP-9) the UN Framework Convention for Climate Change now taking place at Milan. The COP-9 meeting has assumed significance in view of the reported decision of Russia not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change. The Kyoto Protocol has long been teetering on the brink ever since the United States withdrew its support and campaign against its supposed weaknesses. Taking 1990 as the base year for calculation, the United States has 36 per cent and Russia 17 per cent of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions in the developed world. The global community is addressing the challenge of climate change through a multilateral and cooperative approach. The Government of India demonstrated its commitment to address climate change by acceding to the Kyoto Protocol in August last year. India also successfully hosted the 8th Conference of Parties (COP-8) in New Delhi from October 23 to November 1, 2002. The Delhi Ministerial declaration adapted at COP-8 provided a new direction to climate change issues and firmly placed climate change in the context of sustainable development. The conference also succeeded in the operationalisation of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and brought technology transfer and adaptation into focus. Last month New Delhi hosted a Climate Technology Bazaar and related conferences in which about 100 exhibitors from 12 countries showcased state of the art climate friendly technologies. 20 CDM projects with FDI worth 325 million dollars fructified. The Union Cabinet recently approved the setting up of a CDM Authority in the country and the notification to this effect will be issued shortly. At the Milan Conference, Shri Baalu is expected to position India as a leading developing country with the capacity to sale environment friendly technology to other third world countries."
97,10-December-2003 16:38 IST,Prime Minister's Office,PM’S STATEMENT IN PARLIAMENT ON THE RESIGNATION OF SHRI DILIP SINGH JUDEV,"The following is the text of the statement in Parliament by Prime Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee on the resignation of Shri Dilip Singh Judev here today: ""The Delhi edition of The Indian Express dated 16-11-2003 carried a News story and VCD visuals allegedly showing Shri Dilip Singh Judev, then Union Minister of State for Environment and Forests, receiving cash from one Shri Rahul in the presence of Shri Natwar Rateria, Assistant Private Secretary to the Minister. Shri Dilip Singh Judev submitted his resignation which was accepted by the President on my recommendation on 17-11-2003. On my direction, the Cabinet Secretariat forwarded on 17-11-2003 press clippings from various newspapers to the CBI for appropriate action. On the basis of the above Indian Express News story and other print and electronic media reports, the CBI registered a Preliminary Enquiry on 18-11-2003 against Shri Judev, his APS Shri Natwar Rateria, and Shri Rahul, purportedly a representative of an Australian Mining Company. The decision to register a Preliminary Enquiry or a regular case or file a chargesheet is a decision taken by the CBI. The Government does not interfere in these decisions. The CBI has also sent notices to both Shri Judev and Shri Rateria requiring them to appear before the CBI. It has been the policy of my Government that all allegations pertaining to corruption should be thoroughly inquired into. Accordingly, the CBI is inquiring into this whole matter and it would be premature to state anything till the inquiry is complete. As Hon’ble Members are aware, the CBI has full functional autonomy and, under the recently enacted Central Vigilance Commission Act, the superintendence of the CBI in relation to offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act has been vested by the Government in the Central Vigilance Commission. There should, therefore, be no fear or misgiving regarding the independence of this inquiry. I would like to assure this august House that the truth will soon be out and the law will take its own course."""
98,10-December-2003 16:40 IST,Ministry of Human Resource Development,INFORMATION COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY TO BE USED IN A BIG WAY FOR EXPANSION OF HIGHER EDUCATION: DR JOSHI PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES ASKED TO COMPLY WITH UGC REGULATIONS WITHIN THREE MONTHS CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE OF HRD MINISTRY MEETS,"Information and communication technology will be used in a big way to expand higher education and improve the quality of teaching in colleges spread all over the country. This was stated by the Union HRD and S&T Minister Dr. Murli Manohar Joshi while addressing the parliamentary Consultative Committee addressed to his Ministry, here last evening. Emphasizing that huge financial resources would be required to cater to the future needs and to create infrastructure for quality education and research, Dr. Joshi said that the only alternative available is to use modern technologies such as satellite communication, internet and electronics. He informed that a large number of initiatives have been taken in the recent years towards this, with promising results. Out of 309 universities, 124 have already been connected with the UGC Information Network and the rest would be connected by March next year. All over-15000 colleges will eventually become part of this network. To facilitate research and multi-media communication, the communication backbone is being expanded manifold from the present 8 mbps level. From 1st January this year, 120 journals in science and technology disciplines and 250 in humanities and other disciplines have been made available electronically to the universities at a low cost. A satellite devoted exclusively to education is proposed to be launched within the next few months to make quality study material available through television and other communication channels. Dr. Joshi also informed that keeping in view the requirements of the globalised economy and also to provide employment to the rising population of educated youth, a dual education mode is being introduced at the under graduate level. Under it, UGC is asking universities and colleges to introduce utility-oriented programmes along with the traditional degrees. This will enable students to have utility-oriented certificates along with their undergraduate degree, or two degrees in a span of four years. While this would make higher education relevant and productive, it would also lead to better utilisation of available infrastructure, he said. The meeting was also informed of the steps initiated to improve the quality of teaching and research. It was informed that at post-graduate level a credit-based, modular approach is being introduced. UGC has recently upgraded monetary support at individual, group and department levels and has opened for colleges such incentive schemes as were earlier confined to universities. While five universities were identified this year, with potential for excellence, viz. Chennai, Hyderabad, Jadhavpur, Pune and Jawaharlal Nehru Open University, five more universities will be identified next year to promote excellence among universities especially in matters of research. Four national-level institutes are also being established at Bhubaneshwar, Chennai, Pune and Allahabad. It was informed that UGC has started monitoring the health of universities using parameters for academic performance, research performance and governance. It intends to provide incentives to universities and colleges scoring high on these parameters. Stressing that despite many recent initiatives, the quality of research still remains a matter of concern, Dr. Joshi asked UGC to promote scientific excellence in teaching institutions at a fast pace. While welcoming the exchange of students among countries, he said that if the quality of teaching and research in Indian universities is brought to top global standards, such exchanges of students would be economically beneficial to the country. Dr. Joshi also expressed concern at the low interest shown by students in basic sciences. Arguing that today’s technologies are the outcome of fundamental research undertaken in the past, Dr. Joshi called upon UGC to see how students’ interest in basic sciences could be rejuvenated. He informed that the Government has decided to observe 2004 as the year of scientific awareness and a vigyan rail, i.e. science exhibition on wheels, is being flagged off by the Prime Minister next week. In the presentation for the Members of Parliament, it was informed that a large number of private universities have come up in the recent past, especially in Chhattisgarh. Members expressed concern over mushrooming of institutions of learning without requisite infrastructure and faculty. UGC informed the Members that it has recently issued regulations for establishment and maintenance of private universities and the Council has asked the private universities already established to comply with the regulations within three months failing which their degrees would be de-recognised. Dr. Joshi also emphasised the need for promotion of sports in universities. He also agreed with the members that the working of UGC needs to be reviewed in the present context and informed that an amendment to the UGC Act is being drafted to give more teeth to the Council to enable it to usher in reforms in the higher education sector. The following members were present from Lok Sabha : S/Shri/ Ms. Sharad Pawar, Savshibhai Makwana, Dr.Beatrix D’Souza, Vinay Kumar Sorake Ananta Nayak and Ramseth Thakur. The members present from Rajya Sabha were: S/Shri/Ms. Savita Sharda, Chandra Kala Pandey, Dr. A.K. Patel, Dr. Kumkum Rai, Dr. Faguni Ram, K.Rahman Khan, Jayantilal S. Barot and Dr. Bimal Jalan."

This was stated by the Union Minister of State for Water Resources, Smt. Bijoya Chakravarty while addressing the Valedictory session of the two-day meet of the Rotary International Presidential Celebration on Water Management here today. She said that everybody is aware of the importance of water in our life, and about its scarcity value as per capita availability of water is reducing day by day due to galloping population. In order to meet the challenges resulting from growing demands and decreasing availability of water, it is imperative to adopt best practices in the areas of water management to fulfil aspiration of all sections of the society. She emphatically said that there is need for involvement of stakeholders as envisaged in our National Water Policy 2002in every stage of planning and management of water resources. The objective of the Ministry of Water Resources to educate the people to conserve and maintain quality of water without further exploitation of groundwater for industries and irrigation. She said this can be achieved only if all sectors like irrigation, domestic, and industries adopt efficient system. As Agriculture Sector is the largest user of water, appropriate measures like reduction in seepage losses in canal, use of better techniques and adoption of better agricultural practices are to be followed. Another area which requires immediate attention is the improvement of water delivery systems, she remarked. It is, therefore, to adopt tools such as benchmarking for introspection, performance evaluation and improvement in efficiency of the system. The Planning and Management of the Water Resources is required to be done on long term perspective based on minimum reasonable demand of the sector. Looking at the gravity of the problem, 2003 is being celebrated as Freshwater Year in keeping with the United Nations’ Resolutions to create awareness regarding scarcity value of fresh water and its conservation, perseverance and its quality and maintenance of its eco-system by initiating community partnership for informed decision making. Shri V. K. Duggal, Secretary, Ministry of Water Resources addressing the distinguished gathering, in his opening remarks said that the theme selected for the Celbrations ‘Water Management’ is indeed extremely topical particularly in view of the observance of the Freshwater Year 2003 World wide. Water has been engaging unprecedented attention at United Nations with the World Summit on Sustainable Development at Johannesburg and Commission on Sustainable Development in New York dedicating major time and resource with the issue of water. He valued greatly the last two days discussion on various important topics related to water management, which are of great importance for the overall development of the country on the water front. Both the Minister and the Secretary of the Ministry expressed the views that they are indeed looking forward to the recommendations of this Conference which would find their rightful place in future policy initiatives. Shri Sushil Gupta, Director, Rotary International gave the welcome address of the Valedictory function in the presence of President Rotary International, Mr. Jonathan B.

Taking part at the First Round Table of the High Level segment of COP-9 at Milan last night, the Environment and Forests Minister, Shri T.R.Baalu said that serious action to overcome these barriers is needed, without further delay, as the adverse impact of climate change is already being felt by poor and developing countries who are most vulnerable to extreme climate events such as floods, droughts and severe heat waves. Talking on the issue of sustainable development, Shri Baalu said that it involves realization of synergies and complementarities between economic growth and environmental protection. These in turn are dependent on several factors such as technological change, trade regimes, historical patterns of access to global resources and national policies. ""As far as India is concerned, all facets of sustainable development must contribute positively to the dominant challenge of our times-that of poverty alleviation,"" Shri Baalu said. Citing various projections about Green House Gas emissions from the developed countries, Shri Baalu said that it may increase by 10 per cent over the 1990 levels by 2010. Emissions from countries with economies in transition are also starting to increase. ""Effective action needs to be taken by the industrialized countries for curtailing GHG emissions both domestically and through cooperative mechanisms,"" he said. Turning to the issue of adaptation, Shri Baalu said, it must enhance the ability of developing countries to effectively cope with unavoidable climate changes. Adaptation measures must be embodied in their overall sustainable strategies. Reiterating the need for early operationalisation of the special climate fund and the LDC fund as agreed at COP-8, Shri Baalu said that adaptation measures need to be supported and facilitated through financial and technology transfers by Annexure-II parties under their United Nations Framework Convention On Climate Change (UNFCCC) commitments. Opening the ministerial round table discussions, the President of COP-9 and the Minister of Environmental Protection and Water Management of Hungary, Mr.Miklos Persanyi paid glowing tributes to the initiative of Shri Baalu for bringing the linkage between climate change and sustainable development to the fore at the COP-8 meeting in New Delhi last year.

He also suggested that a specific project may be taken up on vulnerability assessment and adaptation in stretches in Tamil Nadu in cooperation with local communities like fishermen to study climate change propelled rise in sea level and weather related events such as cyclones. Ms. Dobriansky gave an account of the Research and Development being carried out in the United States towards a Hydrogen Economy. While appreciating the objectives of the Project Shri Baalu said that any research and development should lead to the technology being socio-economically viable and within the reach of common man. He said that a cost benefit analysis of the programme should be taken up and added that vulnerable sections should be able to make use of the technology for operating small pump sets and satisfying their basic needs like drawing water."

The work has been entrusted to the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC). The Commission will review the existing ceiling of income/wealth to determine the `Creamy Layer’ amongst OBCs. It will also evolve and suggest formulae through which the periodic revision of income ceiling/ criteria in terms of quantum of rupee be fixed so that the income ceiling for determining the `Creamy Layer’ amongst OBCs is revised from time to time as per the formula. The Commission has been requested to submit its recommendations to the Government within three months. This was stated by the Social Justice and Empowerment Minster Dr. Satyanarayan Jatiya in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today. The National Commission for Backward Classes Act, 1993 stipulates that the Central Government shall undertake revision of the lists at the expiration of ten years with a view to exclude those classes who have ceased to be backward. The provision has been made following direction of the Supreme Court in Indira Sawhney & Others v/s Union of India case popularly known as Mandal Case. The underline philosophy for periodic revision is that the reservation should be only for those backward classes that are genuinely deserving and are handicapped without it. Castes and Communities, which have advanced to a certain level of advancement, should be replaced by those who have not reached that stage of development and are in great need of reservation. The Backward Classes ( other than SCs/STs) account for about 52% of the country’s total population and there is enormous rang of diversity among them in terms of occupation, customs and level of development."

126,11-December-2003 17:43 IST,Ministry of Rural Development,Constitution Amendment Bill for ushering in second generation reforms for financial and administrative empowerment of PRIs – Kashiram Rana,"Ministry of Rural Development is processing the case for bringing about for the constitution amendments for speedy and effective devolution of financial and administrative powers of Panchayati Raj Institutions(PRIs). An amendment bill to the constitution in this regard will be introduced shortly in Parliament. This was informed by Shri Kashiram Rana, Union Minister for Rural Development in a Consultative Committee meeting attached to his ministry here today. Shri Rana further informed that the 73rd Amendment Act made constitution of PRIs and regular elections to them every five year mandatory for the States. But as regards the devolution of powers to PRIs and other functional aspects, the decision making was left to the State Legislatures. Today we have approximately 2,50,000 Panchayats and about three million people have been elected of which one-third are women. This is the largest single representative base and the world’s largest experiment in local democracy. Shri Rana expressed concern that administrative and fiscal decentralization however, has fallen far short of what was desirable. Shri Rana observed that people living in far corners of rural India have become quite aware of the issues of governance and development. As the markets become more and more competitive, infrastructure requirements are increased, people demand viable and speedy solutions to their day to day problems. The only way to meet this challenge and to fulfill the aspirations of the people is to engage them in the development process and social audit through Gram Sabhas. Listing out various steps taken by the Ministry for empowering of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs), Shri Rana highlighted that Rural Development Ministry has already transferred decision making and implementation and financial powers to PRIs in respect of its programmes. The Sampoorna Grameen Rozgar Yojana (SGRY) is implemented through Panchayts. Through recent Guidelines of Hariyali, implementation of Watershed Development Programmes namely IWDP, DPAP and DDP has been transferred to PRIs. Panchayats have also been assigned the implementation of Swajaldhara. Selection of beneficiaries in all the programmes is to be done by Panchayats. Members lauded the efforts made by the Ministry for instituting the awards for the Best Panchayats. They were in a view that it would encourage Panchayats to excel in performance of their role. Members raised the issue of holding regular meeting for Vigilance and Monitoring committees. They also suggested for training of elected representatives and for constitution of District Planning Committees. Shri Rana replied that for the training of elected representatives and functionaries of Panchayats, support is provided by National Institutes of Rural Development (NIRD) in terms of training of trainers, development of materials and other guidance. Action Plan from 22 State Governments for providing training to elected and official functionaries of PRIs has been approved by the Ministry and the State Governments are encouraged to use all available infrastructure and networking with NGOs and other institutions for the training. Shri Rana said that regarding constitution of DPCs, he will take up this issue with the State Governments. Members who attended meeting are Shri B.C. Yadav, Shri A.F. Golam Osmani, Shri Chintaman Wanga. Shri Y.V. Rao, Shri Saif-ud-din-Soz, Shri P.S. Gandhvi, Shri M. Vasva, Shri M.K. Patel, Shri R.S. Shakya, Shri B.K. Katara, Shri B.P. Solanki, Shri P.D.

128,11-December-2003 17:46 IST,Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas,Smt. Sumitra Mahajan places National Auto Fuel Policy in the Lok Sabha,"Smt Sumitra Mahajan, Minister of State for Petroleum & Natural Gas, laid the National Auto Fuel Policy on the Table of the Lok Sabha today. The policy provides a clear cut road map for changes in vehicular technology and corresponding fuel quality for the whole country. Measures are also proposed to reduce emissions from in-use vehicles. It is expected that the implementation of the policy would lead to better ambient air quality which will reflect through improvement in public health and better environment. The salient features of the National Auto Fuel Policy include compliance of Bharat Stage-II norms by all new vehicles (other than 2/3 wheelers) from 1.4.2005 in the whole country and Euro-III equivalent norms in the whole country from 1.4.2010. In 11 major cities which include Delhi/NCR, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Pune, Surat, Kanpur and Agra the new vehicles would meet Euro-III equivalent norms from 1.4.2005 and Euro-IV norms from 1.4.2010. New 2/3 wheelers would be required to meet Bharat Stage-II norms from 1.4.2005 and Bharat Stage-III norms preferably from 1.4.2008 but not later than 1.4.2010. In respect of in-use vehicles, the policy suggests new improved Pollution Under Control (PUC) checking system, inspection and maintenance system, checking system for catalytic converter and conversion kits for CNG/LPG vehicles. Another significant feature of the policy include a road map for compliance of emission norms by buses/trucks plying on Inter-State routes passing through Delhi and 10 other major cities mentioned above which have high level of environmental pollution. Inter-State buses/trucks would not be allowed to originate or terminate in Delhi from 1.4.2007 unless they meet India 2000 emission norms and the cut-off point for Bharat Stage-II norms will be 1.4.2011. Emission norms for Inter-State buses originating or culminating in 10 other major cities will have to meet a minimum of 1996 norms w.e.f. 1.4.2006, if registered before 1.4.2000 and India 2000 norms, if registered after 1.4.2000. For Inter-State buses registered after 1.4.2005 in these cities will have to meet at least Bharat Stage-II norms w.e.f. 1.4.2011. It is estimated that the existing domestic oil refineries, in addition to the investment of Rs. 10,000 crore already made to achieve Euro-I/Bharat Stage-II auto fuel specifications, would need to incur an additional investment of around Rs. 18,000 crore by the year 2005. Further investment of around Rs. 12,000 crore will need to be made during the period 2005-2010. The investment requirement of the automobile industry is estimated at around Rs. 25,000 crore over this period. The Policy suggests, taking into account security of supplies and existing logistics perspectives, that liquid fuels should remain as main auto fuels throughout the country. The policy recommends encouraging use of CNG/LPG in cities affected by higher pollution levels so as to enable vehicle owners to have the choice of the fuel and technology combination. To accelerate development of other alternative clean technologies like battery-powered vehicles, hydrogen and fuel cell vehicles, etc., Auto Fuel Policy suggests that a comprehensive support programme should be drawn up. Technologies for producing ethanol/bio fuels and vehicles to use these fuels would be encouraged through R & D and other fiscal and financial measures. The policy also recommends scientific studies for collection of sufficient air quality data for the whole country and to apportion the health disorders attributable to air pollution/vehicular pollution. The policy has been formulated taking a holistic view of the diverse aspects of auto emissions, auto technologies and auto fuel quality on the one hand and the social costs and security of fuel supply on the other. A Committee of Experts of national repute headed by Dr. R.A. Mashelkar, Director General, Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR), was set up to recommend an appropriate Auto Fuel Policy for the country."

Highlighting important software applications developed and adopted in India, Shri Arun Shourie said that Indian firms equip people in over 55 countries for the Information Society. Several cyber cities and training centres in other countries are being set up. In this connection, he referred to the recent setting up of the Kofi Anan Centre for Excellence jointly by the Prime Minister of India and the President of Ghana in Accra via. Video tele-conferencing. He said that Indian Government would redouble such initiatives. About the constitution of a Working Group to ascertain the feasibility and effectiveness of setting up a Fund for Advancing Information Society by the Summit, the Minister offered greater assistance financially and by way of training and equipping people for the new Society and by sharing substantial experience that India has acquired in the spheres of e-governance, tele-medicine, imparting literacy, information security, language technologies etc. The Minister urged that the group should examine issues relating to Internet Governance and help in devising ways to prevent terrorists and other adversaries from disrupting such progressively integrated systems. Speaking about India’s accomplishments in the field of Information Technology, the Minister stated that India earns around $11 billion from the export of IT services and products every year. One-third of the start-ups in Silicon Valley were by Indians.

146,11-December-2003 23:02 IST,Ministry of Shipping,"Press Note Murder of Shri S.K. Dubey, Dy. General Manager, NHAI, Gaya; Response from the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways","Shri S.K. Dubey, Dy. General Manager (Technical), National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), posted at Gaya, was murdered in the early hours of 27 November, 2003. A series of articles and news items have appeared on this unfortunate incident. These have understandably created a sense of shock and an outpouring of sympathy for Shri Dubey. His loss is deeply mourned by his colleagues in NHAI as well as by the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways. In his tribute to Shri Dubey, honourable Prime Minister has called him ""an upright and dedicated officer"" and assured the nation that ""those responsible for his death, wherever they may be, will not be spared"". The case has already been handed over to the CBI for an impartial enquiry. However, a section of the media, without highlighting all the relevant facts of the matter, has drawn misleading inferences on the cause of Shri Dubey’s murder. Its coverage has also sought to project the functioning of the NHAI and the Government in a negative light, showing them to be insensitive and callous about the safety of the personnel working on the National Highways Development Project (NHDP), which is India’s proud infrastructure project. The main thrust of this coverage has been that Shri Dubey was murdered because the office of the Prime Minister, to whom he had addressed a letter in November 2002, alleging systemic deficiencies in the execution of the NHDP and corrupt practices of contractors as well as officials in NHAI, breached the confidentiality of that letter in spite of his request that secrecy be maintained about his identity. To substantiate this inference, it has been reported that the letter was sent in a routine manner by the PMO to the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways and onward to NHAI. This grave insinuation is as untenable as it is unfair. Did PMO or MoRTH disclose his identity in any way? No. Is his murder linked to any action of PMO or MoRTH? No. The facts about the above-mentioned letter are as follows: - The letter received by the PMO November 11, 2002 was unsigned and undated; The sheet enclosed to the letter giving Shri Dubey’s name and particulars was also unsigned; The letter was received in an ordinary cover and was neither addressed by name nor sealed. The PMO receives between 400-500 letters every day, of which a significant number are anonymous or improperly identified letters alleging irregularities and corruption. The PMO has no way of knowing the genuineness of these letters, nor is its function to take action on their specific contents. The latter is the responsibility of the concerned administrative ministry. In the past, some of these letters, especially those without proper identification, have been found to be fake and written with a malicious intent to harm the person in whose name it is sent or the persons/institutions mentioned in it. The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) has instructed all government departments that anonymous or improperly identified letters should not be acted upon. However, since Shri Dubey’s letter carried an annexure that gave his name and address, and contained seemingly important observations on the implementation of NHDP, the PMO forwarded it to the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways for appropriate action. If anything, this shows the responsiveness of the PMO. The passing on of Shri Dubey’s letter within the governmental system -- from the PMO to the concerned administrative ministry – does not constitute ""breach of confidentiality"". Indeed, the PMO did the right thing by doing so, especially since Shri Dubey had said in the concluding para of his letter that ""if any elaboration/clarification is needed on above issues I would be glad to render all my assistance in the interest of this very prestigious National Highway Development Project, which is undoubtedly the biggest ever project undertaken in India after Independence."" (Emphasis added.) Similarly, neither MoRTH nor NHAI disclosed Shri Dubey’s identity in any manner. The Chief Vigilance Officer of NHAI called Shri Dubey to ascertain whether the letter was indeed written by him. He confirmed this. It is also worth noting here that Shri Dubey, in his letter to the Manager (Vigilance), NHAI, dated February 2, 2003, said, ""I confirm having written the said letter. The letter intended to be addressed to the Chairman, NHAI with only a copy endorsed to the office of the PMO was inadvertently addressed to the PMO. The letter was also addressed and sent to Chairman, NHAI."" This clearly shows that Shri Dubey had already, on his own, disclosed his identity to the head of his own organization. Hence, the accusation that the PMO ""disclosed"" Shri Dubey’s identity by passing on his letter to MoRTH is both bizarre and false. The section of the media that has made this accusation has failed to take note of the important fact that Shri Dubey sent several communications to local officers of NHAI and consultants. While his letter to the Prime Minister had raised mainly general issues about perceived procedural shortcomings in the implementation of NHDP, his local communications were very specific. These communications were not marked secret. Therefore, it is not proper to link Shri Dubey’s murder to the letter he addressed to the Prime Minister more than a year earlier. Like many of his colleagues, Shri Dubey had been very vigilant in implementation of sections under the jurisdiction of Koderma Project Implementation Unit. He was diligently pointing out lapses in execution or supervision of works to the Project Director concerned of the NHAI, to the contractor as well as to the supervision consultant. Between December 2002 and August 2003 Shri Dubey made four major specific reports, in writing, against the personnel of the contractor and the supervisory consultant. How did MoRTH and NHAI respond to Shri Dubey’s communications? In an exemplary manner. Media reports have not highlighted how NHAI acted on Shri Dubey’s communications. The Vigilance Office of NHAI merely cautioned him of the impropriety he had committed in writing a letter directly to the Prime Minister. However, Shri Dubey was not penalized for writing directly to the Prime Minister. On the contrary, on 31 October, 2003, he was promoted to the post of Dy. General Manager in NHAI in recognition of his professional competence and his courageous, conscientious and persistent efforts to improve the implementation of the work on NHDP at his level. This point, which has not been highlighted in media reports, again shows how NHAI was – and continues to be -- appreciative of an honest and committed officer like Shri Dubey. Shri Dubey’s letter was taken with all seriousness. NHAI officials at the headquarters fully shared Shri Dubey’s concerns and views regarding the need to improve various activities in NHDP such as preparation of detailed project reports, award of civil works, etc. He was called to NHAI headquarters with a view to obtaining specific details in the matter. Also, suitable corrective action had already been initiated on several points contained in his communications. Also, responding to Shri Dubey’s other communications mentioned above, the Koderma Project Implementation Unit of NHAI removed four engineers and two lab assistants of the Contractor and Supervision Consultant. Based on the shortcomings that he had pointed out, nearly a kilometer of substandard granular sub base layer of the road was asked to be completely dug up and re-laid. NHAI’s own proactive action to improve the implementation of NHDP The NHAI itself was fully alive to the shortcomings of the existing systems and had already initiated a series of measures to improve upon the procedures. In a gigantic and first-of-its-kind project like the NHDP, involving upgradation of over 14,000 km of national highways at the cost of Rs. 58,000 crore within a tight timeframe, there is always scope for improvement and refinement. Here are some of the proactive steps taken by NHAI. 1) The NHAI has been following internationally approved procurement procedures, which are open and transparent. It follows the Federation Internationale des Ingenieurs Conseils (FIDIC) conditions in implementing the NHDP. 2) The Ministry of Road Transport & Highways had already constituted a Committee on 24 July 2001 under the Chairmanship of a retired Director General of Roads to streamline the procedure, documentation and to prepare manuals to facilitate better implementation of NHDP. Another Committee headed by Member (Technical), NHAI was constituted on 10 December, 2002 which has reviewed the procedures and finalised model documents and has suggested further improvements in the prequalification of consultants for preparation of Detailed Project Reports, evaluation of bids and actual preparation of the Reports. 3) A similar exercise has been done for prequalification of contractors. NHAI is also undertaking quality audit of its projects through M/s Engineers India Ltd. It has also appointed M/s PriceWaterhouseCoopers as the Internal Auditors for NHAI headquarters as well as Project Implementation Units (PIUs). The poor law and order situation in Bihar Media reports have not taken into account the serious law and order problem existing in Bihar, where Shri Dubey was working. It is a matter of record that personnel employed in implementation of the NHDP in Bihar have been under constant threat. To cite a few instances, On 30 January, 2003, a group of 100 armed men forcibly entered the camp of the contractor working on NHDP in Gaya district and took 40 people as hostages. On the night of January 31, 2003, in Aurangabad district in Bihar, a group of miscreants invaded the crusher site of an NHDP contractor at Madanpur and ransacked the office and set fire to a jeep and beat up the workers. On 7 May, 2003, in Bhabhua district of Bihar, a driver of an NHDP contractor was shot dead and an engineer injured who also succumbed to injuries. In another tragic incident last year, Shri Sanjay Singh, a young IIT graduate and Indian Forest Service officer posted in Bihar was kidnapped and brutally murdered on 15 February 2002. He had reportedly taken strict action against the mafia engaged in illegal mining and tree felling activities in Sasaram and other areas. NHDP is being simultaneously implemented in many States in the country. It is a verifiable fact that those working on the project in other States are not facing the kind of insecurity and intimidation from criminal and extortionist gangs as in Bihar. Minister’s letters to the CM of Bihar on the law and order problem Between March 2002 and November 2003, the Minister of Road Transport & Highways has written as many as five letters to the Chief Minister of Bihar expressing concern over the law and order problems in the State and urging her urgent attention to the severity of the situation. He had also spoken to her on many occasions and said that unless the law and order problem was addressed earnestly it would be difficult to implement NHDP in Bihar in an effective and timely manner. It may be noted that, in his first letter dated 15 March, 2002 – that is, well before Shri Dubey’s letter to the Honourable PM, the Minister had pointed out to the Chief Minister of Bihar that the people working on NHDP on National Highway No. 2 ""are getting repeated threats on the telephone and warnings of dire consequences in the absence of their not fulfilling demands. Recently, armed personnel attacked a camp and detonated explosives and fired gun shots. This has caused an atmosphere of fear and terror and is coming in the way of progress of the work."" The NHDP Phase I (comprising mainly the Golden Quadrilateral) is progressing very satisfactorily in most States. Out of a total length of 5846 kms, 2005 kms has already been four laned. The target, 96% completion by December, 2004 is likely to be achieved. However, the progress in Bihar has been delayed mainly because of the law and order problem. The status of the projects in Bihar as on 30 November 2003 is as follows: Project Progress (In percent) Target Achieved Mohania – Sasaram 70 21 Sasaram – Dehri-on-Sone 46 05 Dehri-on-Sone – Aurangabad 65 43 Aurangabad – Barachatti 42 12 Shri Dubey will be remembered for his honesty, dedication and professional commitment to the National Highway Development Project. The Ministry of Road Transport & Highways, as well as the National Highways Authority of India, reiterate their commitment to speedy implementation of the NHDP, without any compromise on the quality of construction, and help realize the collective dream of all Indians. In this, we appeal to State Governments to ensure proper security for the project personnel. Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, Govt. of India. Dec11, 2003.

157,14-December-2003 12:2 IST,Ministry of Power,Energy saved today is asset for future: Anant Geete,"""The energy saved today would be an asset for the future"" – said the Union Minister of Power, Shri Anant G. Geete while presenting the National Energy Conservation Awards for the year 2003 here today. He said that while about 45% of our population still didn’t have access to electricity, we were not able to meet the requirements of our industries also. Referring to 15% to 45% energy saving potential of our industries, he reiterated that the solution lies in promoting conservation and restricting misuse of energy. The function was organized to celebrate National Energy Conservation Day. These annual awards are given to recognize innovation and achievements in energy conservation by the large and medium scale industry to raise awareness about energy conservation that plays a big role in reducing global warming through energy savings. Shri Geete told the gathering that all the Central ministries had voluntarily resolved to save up to 30% of their electricity consumption. This year the Excellence Award was given to Indian Aluminum Company Limited, Hirakud. Apart from this, one special prize, eight first prizes, eight second prizes and 18 Certificates of Merit were also awarded to progressive industrial units. The prominent winners for this year's awards include Indian Aluminium Company Limited, Hirakud, Mahindra & Mahindra Limited, Mumbai, Dalmia Cement (Bharat) Limited, Tirchirappalli, Indian Rayon and Industries Ltd., Veraval, Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, Jindal Steel & Power Limited, Patalganga and Hazira plant of Reliance Industries Limited, Gujarat Refinery and Panipat Refinery of Indian Oil Corporation and Jaya Shree Textiles, Rishra, West Bengal. The awardees have demonstrated a high degree of commitment to energy conservation. The Minister lauded the efforts of the Bureau of Energy Efficiency that manages the National Energy Conservation Awards. Established under the Energy Conservation Act 2001, the Bureau is assisting industry and commercial establishments to meet the mandatory provisions of the Act through a voluntary approach. Shri H L Bajaj, Chairman of the Central Electricity Authority proposed the vote of thanks. The secretary, ministry of Power Shri R V Shahi, additional secretary and other senior officers of the Ministry were also present on the occasion. For the Energy Conservation Award 2003, 36 industrial units had been selected from 191 nominations received. These 191 industrial units had been able to collectively avoid generation of 5419 lakhs kWh/year of electrical energy in 2002-2003, which is equivalent to the energy generated from a 103 MW thermal power station at a Plant Load Factor of 60%. In the monetary terms, these units had been able to save Rs. 53940 lakh (Rs. 539 crore) per year on account of electrical and thermal energy saved during the year 2002-2003. In these five years of the Award scheme, the participating industrial units have collectively saved Rs.2291 crores per year and the investment made on energy efficiency projects was recovered back in 16 months.

159,14-December-2003 12:4 IST,Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas,Oil companies set to launch Hydrogen Gas Stations By 2005,"Oil companies in the country are set to launch the nation’s first Hydrogen gas dispensing stations in select cities in the next two to three years, which will serve as a pilot project to prove the efficacy of Hydrogen gas as a clean and environment-friendly automotive fuel. An exclusive fleet of two- and three-wheelers, which can use Hydrogen gas in admixture with CNG (Compressed Natural Gas), would be another option arising out of this pilot project. The oil sector road map for ushering in Hydrogen gas as an alternative fuel in the country was outlined by the Petroleum Secretary, Shri B.K.Chaturvedi, at the conclusion of the first major International Workshop on Hydrogen Energy here on Saturday. Referring to the call given by Shri Ram Naik, Minister for Petroleum & Natural Gas, earlier at the workshop to dedicate the current decade for research on Hydrogen gas, Shri Chaturvedi said that the oil sector, in association with leading automobile manufacturers and research institutes in India and abroad, would chalk out programmes for taking up a few projects to demonstrate the use of Hydrogen initially in a few applications like three-wheelers and portable gensets. The challenging task is to put on the road at least a thousand two- and three-wheelers running on Hydrogen gas by the year 2005, and then move forward to extend its use to light commercial vehicles in the next five years. By 2010, we should aim at having the largest fleet of vehicles operating on Hydrogen gas in India, he said. Describing Hydrogen as another energy revolution in the making, Shri Chaturvedi said that the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas has proposed that the major oil & gas companies in India, which already have the necessary experience, should form a consortium and create a corpus fund for Hydrogen research in the country. As part of this, IndianOil's Research & Development Centre at Faridabad, which has been made the nodal agency, is establishing linkages with various national and international R&D institutes working on Hydrogen gas, besides joining some of the ongoing Hydrogen research programmes. These include a US DOE-sponsored project for production of Hydrogen by Pure Energy Corporation, USA, and the CAR Project (Coopertive Automotive Research) initiated in India. A project proposal from Stuart Energy, Canada, made earlier to ONGC is also being considered by the Oil Industry Development Board (OIDB). IndianOil's R&D Centre is also considering associating itself with an ongoing project on Hydrogen Pathways by an international consortium led by the Institute of Transport Studies, University of California, Davis. Industry efforts to introduce Hydrogen gas technology on a commercial basis need the commitment and support of the best brains in the scientific community in India and abroad, Shri Chaturvedi said. We need several cost-effective technological breakthroughs to cross the hurdles in making Hydrogen gas production, storage and distribution commercially viable in the country, he said. Focussing on the technology options available for production of Hydrogen in the short and long terms, Shri Chaturvedi said that reformation of natural gas is seen as an economical route in the next 10 to 15 years, while production from biomass could be a long-term alternative for a country like India. Production of Hydrogen from Naphtha could be another alternative, especially since the current demand for Naphtha is likely to go down with increased use of gas by the industry. In a large country like India, centralised production of Hydrogen gas may not be viable because of the high transportation costs likely; instead, it would be worthwhile to transport gas/naphtha to different parts for onsite conversion to Hydrogen, he said. Similarly, metal hydrides could be a safe and cost-effective option for storage and use of Hydrogen, especially in two and three-wheelers which have limited daily run, he said. Through the workshop, IndianOil Chairman, Shri M.S.Ramachandran, invited all industry members, institutes and individuals involved in research on Hydrogen to join hands and work together, to quickly reach the benefits of this clean fuel to the common man. Hydrogen fuel is pollution-free, with water as end product, converts easily to electricity with higher efficiencies than combustion processes, and can be used in a broad range of applications. While initially Hydrogen gas may be produced from fossil fuels, the ultimate aim will be to produce it from renewable sources, which will also reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels, thus providing energy security for the country, he said. Stressing IndianOil's commitment to coordinate Hydrogen research in the country, Shri Ramachandran said that introduction of Hydrogen gas will further expand the basket of alternative fuels such as CNG, Autogas (LPG), ethanol-blended petrol and bio-diesel being made available by the oil industry in phases in order to reduce dependence on traditional transport fuels such as petrol and diesel. Over 350 delegates, scientists and research scholars from India and abroad attended the three-day International Workshop organised by Indian Oil Corporation."

161,13-December-2003 12:8 IST,Prime Minister's Office,Prime Minister inaugurates Futures Trading of the National Multi-Commodity Exchange,"The Prime Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee inaugurated the ‘Futures Trading of the National Multi-Commodity Exchange of Ahmedabad’ at a ceremony at 7, Race Course Road here this evening. Speaking on this occasion he said that by inaugurating this exchange, we start a new journey that will bring rewards to all the stakeholders in the commodity markets – to the producer as well as the consumer, to the trader as much as to the national exchequer. However, the Prime Minister cautioned that it should be insured that this system actually benefits the farmers, and not just traders. The following is the full text of the Prime Minister’s speech on this occasion: ""I am very pleased to be with all of you today for the inauguration of an institution that is truly futuristic. I believe that the futures trading of the National Multi-Commodity Exchange in Ahmedabad will make an important contribution to the future development of the Indian economy, especially India’s agricultural economy. The launch of futures trading in wheat and rice is not an ordinary event. With the small step we are taking today by inaugurating this exchange, we start a new journey that will bring rewards to all the stakeholders in the commodity markets – to the producer as well as the consumer, to the trader as much as to the national exchequer. What is especially heartening for me about this initiative is its promise of de-risking Indian agriculture in terms of irrational and erratic price fluctuation. Traditionally the Indian farmer has faced three kinds of risk: the sultani risk, the asmaani risk and the risk of the market. The sultani risk is long over. The risk of depending on the monsoon still exists although it has lessened to some extent because of the expansion of irrigation facilities in many parts of the country. But what worries the farmer often is the uncertainty of what price he’ll get for his produce. Introduction of futures and derivatives contracts in various commodities is an effective instrument to manage the uncertainty in a free market regime and mitigate risks. Now that Indian agriculture has opened up to world markets, this instrument has become all the more necessary. In my Independence Day address last year, I had announced that our Government would soon set up an online commodity exchange in the country. My compliments to the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, and the Central Warehousing Corporation, for implementing this promise. Friends, commodity markets are not new to India. Over the centuries our traders had developed great expertise in this field. However, after Independence we did not pay adequate attention to the needs of our commodity markets for achieving vibrant growth. We did not enable them to respond to the challenges and opportunities in commodity trade worldwide. The result is the strange paradox that we see today. We are one of the largest producers as well as consumers of certain commodities. We also export and import significant quantities of these commodities. However, the price and trading of these commodities are largely influenced by exchanges in developed countries. The other paradox is this. Some of the smartest traders in the commodity markets abroad are Indians. But this will change, just as many things in India are now changing for the better. We want to make India a major trading nation in the world for both farm and non-farm commodities. I am told that, by building a commodity trading exchange of global standards, India has an opportunity to chase a US $ 600 billion market opportunity. For achieving this goal, we have to equip ourselves with the appropriate market instruments and institutions. We have to use the tools of information technology at all levels – from the village mandi to the urban markets. We have to remove restrictions and controls on the internal movement of commodities. We have to bring in legislative changes to enable innovations such as warehouse receipt-based settlement mechanisms. Above all, we have to improve the physical infrastructure and logistics -- from rural roads, to highways, to railways, to port development. As you are aware, we have launched major initiatives to attend to many of these critical needs. We shall do much more in the time to come. On this occasion, I would urge all concerned to keep in mind one guiding principle. You should ensure that this system actually benefits the farmers, and not just traders. For this Central and State Government agencies have to take necessary steps, including rapid expansion of rural warehousing facilities. I would like the regulatory system for commodity exchanges to be strengthened so as to create confidence among all the stakeholders. At the same time, all the recognized and partly recognized exchanges should also put in place their own self-regulatory mechanisms. Ladies and Gentlemen, with this revolutionary initiative on futures trading in Wheat and Rice, following Gold and Silver a couple of months ago, we can say with confidence that Indian agriculture is equipped with yet another modern tool to face global competition. I congratulate all the public and private sector partners in this initiative and wish it every success."""

Earlier in his welcome speech Shri Subhash Maharia, Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution pointed out that the inauguration of Futures Trading in wheat and rice might result in low procurement by government agencies on minimum support price. With the commencement of the online futures trading in wheat and rice the commodities traded on the network of NMCE has gone upto 51 including agro and non-agro products. The Central Warehousing Corporation(CWC), the lead promoter of NMCE will provide access to its vast network of 493 warehouses with a storage capacity of 9.3 million metric tons with additional capacities of State Warehouses in which CWC has 50 per cent partnership."

The Mission document prepared by the Central Silk Board will be finalised in consultation with the States. The Mission will focus on a rapid growth of the sector with emphasis on increasing productivity of quality silk for both domestic and international market. This was stated by the Textiles Minister Shri Syed Shahnawaz Hussain at the inaugural function of the Silk week here today. The suggestion to set up the Technology Mission had earlier come from the Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission Shri K.C. Pant who inaugurated the Silk Week. Shri Pant said, the Planning Commission is giving importance to Sericulture by providing adequate plan funds for its sustained growth. He said, this sector provides employment to about 5 million persons in rural and semi urban areas, large number of whom are women. The sector being labour intensive, the emphasis on this sector is in line with the government’s effort to provide 10 million new employment opportunities every year. Shri Pant said, the share of India’s export of silk is a mere 3.7 percent of the world trade accounting for US $ 450 million in export earnings. India is the second largest producer of raw silk in the world, it is also the largest consumer. He said, the bulk of our production gets easily absorbed into the domestic market. He said, the production of bivoltine silk, needed mainly to meet the high end and export markets, is minimal and mostly met from imports. Shri Pant said, recent breakthrough achieved by the R&D institutions of the Central Silk Board in evolving a technology package for practising tropical bivoltine culture and its increasing acceptance in the field have given new hopes for large scale production of quality silk. Shri Pant asked the Central Silk Board to focus on quality in order to develop niche market for Indian silk products, thereby generating large-scale employment opportunities in the country. He said, the post quota regime beginning 1st January 2005 gives us a chance to recover some of the ground that we have lost in the past. But, he said, we have to move expeditiously to seize the opportunity when it opens. Exhibitions, buyer-seller meet and fashion shows are some of the highlights of the ‘Silk Week’. The three day event is being organised to focus on the various aspect of the sector including the problems faced by the weavers and the producers. Weavers, producers, designers, exporters, buyers, experts, and scientists have been invited to participate in the event. Coinciding with the Silk Week a conference of State Ministers and Secretaries dealing with Sericulture will be held tomorrow to review policy and programmes in the light of emerging WTO imperatives."

192,16-December-2003 14:17 IST,Ministry of Railways,Railway Minister presents Medals to RPF personnel,"The Union Minister of Railways Shri Nitish Kumar presented the President’s Police Medals for Distinguish Service to two personnel of Railway Protection Force (RPF) at an investiture parade here today. The other recipients were 26 personnel with Indian Police Medals for Meritorious Service, two personnel, one with Railway Minister’s Medal for Bravery and the other with Railway Minister’s Medal for Best Investigation. Besides, 108 personnel received Director General’s Insignia and Commendation Certificates. Speaking on the occasion, Shri Nitish Kumar congratulated the recipients for their exemplary performance. He was glad to inform the rank and file of the RPF from the saluting base that greater responsibility and power have devolved on them following the amendment in the Railways Act, 1989 and the Railway Protection Force Act, 1957 conferring on RPF the power of police to arrest, investigate and handover the culprits for heinous crimes together with a report to the Government Railway Police (GRP) for further action based on the RPF report. The Minister was happy to state that the amendments passed in the current session of Parliament have made RPF an effective instrument in the provision of security to the railway passengers and fighting crimes on Railways over and above the existing protection of the railway assets. He said that henceforth the RPF would be effective like police in curbing crimes on Railways except in the areas of heinous crimes under the Indian Penal Code and crimes like sabotage under the Railways Act for which GRP would continue to be responsible. The Minister said that security of railway passengers in trains and at platforms were now the concern of the RPF urging them to rise to the occasion by making a difference in their outlook, approach and work culture. The Minister complimented the RPF as one of the armed forces of the Union for their exemplary performance in conducting peaceful elections in Jammu & Kashmir and the recently concluded elections to the State Assembly of Madhya Pradesh and elsewhere. The Minister exuded confidence that with the new responsibility, the RPF would be able to meet the challenges ahead. He said that hereafter the public perception of RPF as a silent or ineffective spectator in curbing crimes on railways would undergo changes. The Minister assured the RPF that funds wouldn’t be a constraint for provision of new vehicles, new equipment of communications and modernization of RPF. The Minister said that the RPF must deliver and come up to the expectations of the traveling public. It was also an effective instrument in crisis management of Railways, he added. The Railway Minister announced an award of Rs. 50 lakhs for rebuilding subordinate office mess of RPF at Lucknow and a matching sum for all the participants of the spectacular parade and recipients of medals and certificates from Director General, RPF. Earlier, the Director General, RPF, Dr. A.K. Pandey, in his welcome address, demanded adequate funds for replenishment of vehicles and modernization of RPF as an efficient armed forces of the Union.

Later, in 1987, by an amendment in the RPF Act, 1957, it became an Armed Force of the Union. Since then it has been performing onerous duty in combating militancy and elections along with other para-military forces."
193,16-December-2003 14:19 IST,Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation,NSSO releases Reports on Consumption-Expenditure and Unorganised Service Sector,"The National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) has released the reports of its 57th Round survey on Household Consumer Expenditure and Employment-Unemployment Situation and Unorganised Service Sector enterprises. The fieldwork for the survey was conducted during July 2001 to June 2002.

In addition, an annual series of consumer expenditure surveys was started in 1986 by including a consumer expenditure enquiry along with the main subject of survey. Thus, a consumer expenditure schedule was canvassed in four households (two households up to the NSS 48th round, 1992) in very surveyed village and urban block. The schedule was enlarged from the NSS 45th round (1989-90) onwards to collect some basic information on employment and unemployment as well."
194,16-December-2003 14:21 IST,Ministry of Commerce & Industry,India urges dropping of three Singapore issuesCALL FOR SPIRIT OF ACCOMMODATION AS WAY FORWARDINDIA’S INTERVENTION AT THE WTO GENERAL COUNCIL MEETING,"Calling for a spirit of goodwill and accommodation on the part of all members to carry the process of negotiations forward, India has suggested that further work on three Singapore issues viz., trade & investment, trade & competition policy and transparency in government procurement should be dropped from the agenda of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The intervention by India at the General Council meeting of Capital Based Officials (15-16 December, 2003) at the WTO in Geneva indicates that India’s position is in line with the views expressed by a large number of developing and the least developed countries in the General Council document dated 12 December, 2003 on Singapore issues. Regarding Trade Facilitation, India has said that work on clarification of various aspects of this issue may continue in the light of the interest expressed by several delegations, and also that any subsequent decision on modalities should be by explicit consensus. Describing the issue of agriculture as being at the core of the ongoing negotiations, India has stated that: “Resolution of fundamental differences in this area would depend on the depth of agriculture reform that is proposed to be carried out in the developed countries along with adequate safeguards to address livelihood and food security concerns of billions of farmers in developing countries. We have a responsibility to translate the Doha mandate into provisions that would ensure balance across the three pillars (of agricultural negotiations). The right level of ambition in agriculture would be that which balances the extent of reduction in distortions in world markets due to high support and protection in developed countries against the increased vulnerability of billions of farmers in developing countries due to further opening of their markets”. Regarding the framework approach in agriculture and non-agricultural market access to facilitate finalisation of modalities which would form the basis of agricultural and non-agricultural trade liberalisation, India has pointed out that a framework would find acceptance only if certain conditions are fulfilled. The first condition is that it must fully reflect the principles laid down in the Doha mandate, as stated in the G-20 Ministerial Communiqué issue at Brasilia last week i.e., that any framework to be viable must “lead to the establishment of modalities capable of ensuring that negotiations in agriculture would result in substantial reductions in domestic support, substantial increase in market access, phasing out of all forms of export subsidies and operation of an effective special & differential treatment that takes into account rural development and food security concerns of developing countries”. Secondly, the framework must not be ambiguous or uncertain, eg., the blend approach to market access suggested in the Derbez text as it seems to impact differently on member countries depending on tariff dispersion prevalent in each country and does not take into account the cardinal principle of S&D treatment through less than full reciprocity. Thirdly, it should not be structured in a manner that will prejudice the position of member countries in further negotiations. The issue of cotton subsidies, raised by several African countries, deserves concrete action, the statement adds. On non-agricultural market access (NAMA), India has emphasised the need to remain faithful to the Doha Declaration, especially the principle of less than full reciprocity in reduction commitments for developing countries. “The right way forward does not appear to be a simple Swiss Formula with a single coefficient nor the concept of harmonisation of tariffs. The formula proposed by the Chairman of the negotiation group incorporated suitable S&D provisions and we are willing to work further on this…. It also needs to be recognised that developing countries need a degree of flexibility with respect to sensitive products…. Sectoral initiative should be voluntary rather than mandatory for developing countries”, India has said. It has also reiterated that non-tariff barriers which are an integral part of NAMA negotiations should be adequately dealt with. Pointing out that there has hardly been any progress in the resolution of implementation issues, India has called upon the General Council or the Trade Negotiations Committee of the WTO to create a separate negotiating body exclusively for implementation issues and special & differential treatment issues. This negotiating body should also address the issue of commodity price stabilisation in agricultural products raised by Kenya and other African countries in the run-up to Cancun, as this is an unresolved issue of great significance to many developing countries. India has emphasised the need for concerted and conscious efforts to ensure that the development dimension of the negotiation is not diluted, but occupies the centrestage, as this alone will ensure progress of trade liberalisation on a sustained basis."
196,16-December-2003 15:36 IST,Ministry of Water Resources,Government going full throttle for widening and enlarging the scope of rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge for adopting watershed approach in planning and developing water resources,"The Union Minister for Water Resources, Shri Arjun Charan Sethi participating in an Interactive Session with over 30 Members of Parliament informed the august gathering that creating awareness on Rainwater harvesting, recharge of Groundwater and increasing the storage capacity of the Reservoirs in the country engaged the utmost attention of the Ministry of Water Resources here.

Besides, Minister for Water Supply, Government of Karnataka took part in the deliberations. Shri V. K. Duggal, Secretary, Ministry of Water Resources thanked the participants for their valuable suggestions and assured them that their suggestions will be looked into by the Ministry.

201,16-December-2003 16:52 IST,Ministry of Environment and Forests,A composite action plan to be in place in time for management of prospective flowering of Bamboos in North-EastREMOVAL OF RESTRICTIONS ON EXPORT OF MULI BAMBOO WILL BE SOUGHTA TASK FORCE TO BE CONSTITUTED TO SUGGEST MEASURES TO CONTROL FOR POSSIBLE WIDESPREAD GROWTH OF RODENTS,"The Steering Committee on the Management of Prospective Gregarious Flowering of Muli Bamboos (Melocana Bacciferra) in Mizoram and other states in the North Eastern region has decided to approach the Government for removing restrictions on the export of Muli Bamboos at the earliest. At its second meeting under the chairmanship of Shri Prodipto Ghosh, Secretary, Ministry of Environment and Forests in New Delhi today it also decided to set up a task force which will look into the possible explosion in population of rodents which is associated with gregarious flowering of bamboos and suggest measures to control them so that they do not form a part of the chain of events leading to famine, as has happened in the past. The Steering Committee felt that large scale extraction of Muli Bamboos have to be carried out before the flowering takes place and regeneration of mixed vegetative growth will be required to keep such problems in future under control. Every possible use of the extracted bamboos have to be explored so that the local communities get the benefit of it. It is estimated that about 26 million tones of Muli Bamboos will be affected out of which 10 million are in accessible areas and the rest 16 million in inaccessible areas about which nothing can be done. It was decided that the bamboos extracted from the accessible areas will be sold in open auction on a day to day basis. It may be recalled that India is endowed with 125 species of bamboos belonging to 23 genera of the sub family Bambusoideae of family poaeeae. India has the largest bamboo resource in the world and bamboo forest in India occupy an area of 10.03 million hectares which is roughly 12.8 per cent of the total area of the country. Most of the bamboo species flower after the end of a long number of years of vegetative growth. The flowering is synchronous over vast tracks of landscape and this phenomenon is called gregarious flowering. This gregarious flowering is followed by death of the bamboo clumps. Such a peculiar behavior of bamboo sometimes create problems for ecology and human beings. The gregarious flowing of bamboo results in production of large quantities of seeds which in turn supports population explosion in rats. However the quantity of seeds available for rats diminishes soon after the germination of seeds following rains. The resultant short supply of bamboo seeds on the one hand and a large population of rats on the other leads to a scenario where the rodents head towards farmlands in adjoining areas causing wide spread lose to crops. Such a chain of events has the potential to cause famine. The last gregarious flowering of Muli Bamboo had taken place in 1959 and its cycle is 48 years. The next gregarious flowering is expected to start next year and reach its peak in 2007. Muli Bamboos are found mostly in Mizoram. Other states such as Nagaland, Tripura, Manipur, Meghalaya and Assam have also got some stretches of this plant. It is believed that the Mizo National Front Movement was triggered by the famine of 1959 which was an off shoot of gregarious flowering of Muli Bamboos. The first meeting of the Steering Committee at its meeting on Augsut 5, 2003 had constituted two committees to give recommendations on how to tackle the impending problem. The first Task Force chaired by Shri R.P.S.Katwal, Director General of Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE) was given the task of suggesting measures for regeneration of the landscape to be cleared of Muli Bamboos. In its report submitted to the Steering Committee today, it has suggested a mixed vegetative growth in the post GF stage. It would result in greater economic strength for the local communities. The committee felt that Muli Bamboo has restricted use for the industry and it also decays very fast once extracted. The second Task Force headed by the Chief Secretary of Mizoram was to look into the use of the extracted bamboos. In its report the committee has suggested adoption of an improved and modified system of harvesting and marketing. The Steering Committee in its discussion today decided that the extraction and regeneration should be done through local communities and joint forest management groups. It also felt that an action plan should be drawn up to smoothen the future supply curve of bamboos. The next meeting of the Steering Committee will be held in April 2004 to take stock of the situation. Those who participated in the meeting today included representatives from the Planning Commission, State Trading Corporation, Paper Industry, Ministry of Environment and Forests, North Eastern States such as Mizoram, Tripura and Manipur and ICFRE."

207,16-December-2003 17:7 IST,"Ministry of Micro,Small & Medium Enterprises",A global revival of interest in complimentary system of health care: Dr. C.P.Thakur INDIA EMERGING A DESTINATION FOR HEALTH TOURISM,"A large number of patients from all over the world have started coming to India as Health Tourists. The development of herbal drugs, nutraceuticals, cosmeceuticals will go a long way in providing ""Health For All"" and in improving the socio-economic status of the country. This was stated by Dr. C.P.Thakur, at the inaugural session of the second International Conference on Herbal Drugs and Health Tourism at India International Centre here today. Improvement in health status of population has been one of the major thrust areas in social development programmes of the country. Technological improvements and increased access to health care have resulted in a steep fall in mortality , but disease burden due to communicable and non-communicable diseases , environmental pollution and nutritional problems continue to be high. With the 1990’s, the country has entered an era of dual disease burden; communicable diseases (Malaria, Kala Azar, Filaria, Dengue T.B., HIV/AIDS etc.)on the one hand and non-communicable diseases(coronary artery disease, hypertension, neurological disorders, asthma , etc.) on the other. Under Nutrition despite sufficient availability of food poses another problem.30% of new born children are significantly underweight and nearly 60% of pregnant women are anaemic. In addition, The World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned that there will be a Diabetes epidemic in India by 2010. Globally, there has been a revival of interest in complementary system of health care, especially in the prevention and management of chronic lifestyle related non-communicable diseases and those diseases for which there is no effective drug in Ayurvedic system of health care. Herbal drugs are non-narcotic and easily available at affordable prices . India has been blessed with many efficacious systems of medicine like the Ayurveda, Unani, Yoga, Naturopathy, Homeopathy and Siddha .All these systems open new vistas for health tourism in the country and to bring prosperity to the country. There has been a paradigm shift in drug delivery technologies from conventional dosage forms to controlled release and sophisticated delivery systems. The emergence of Bio-pharmaceutic classification system (BCS) has further simplified drug development program from a regulatory perspective. The need of the hour for us is to optimize the benefits available from this opportunity because India has immense potential and rich bio-diversity. The accumulated knowledge of Indian System of medicine and large bio-diversity of our country offer a great advantage to drug industry. India has also adopted guidelines on ""good clinical practice"" in line with the global norms. The country provides opportunity for pharmaceutical companies because of the availability of large patient populations, many scientists and lower cost of operations. The Government of India has allocated adequate funds for drug discovery programmes, development of nutraceuticals and cosmeceuticals etc. Now, there is a strong case for industry-institution –academia alliances to human and veterinary drug development programme. For production of medicinal plants the country has already created National Medicinal Plants Board at the central level and State medicinal plants boards at state level. Development of drugs , nutraceuticals and cosmeceuticals, their large scale production and marketing will go a long way in providing health and nutritional security besides boosting the export of the country."
209,16-December-2003 17:23 IST,Ministry of Textiles,Textiles Minister calls for structural changes to increase quality silk production,"The Textiles Minister Shri Syed Shahnawaz Hussain has called for structural changes in sericulture keeping in view the potential for growth in the sector. Addressing a day long conference of State Ministers and Secretaries in charge of Sericulture here today, he said the sector needs management reforms and legislative changes by the States in order to meet the plan targets. The 10th Plan has set a target of 26450 tonnes of raw silk out of which the share of bivoltine silk is 7000 tonnes and also to double the production of non-mulberry silk. The Minister said although we have set a higher target for bivoltine silk but we did not take steps to establish the link between the cocoon growers and reelers. He said, contract farming can be adopted in sericulture where a group of farmers and reelers would work together for production of large quantities of uniform quality cocoons and raw silk of international grade. It will also become easier to disseminate the new technology packages developed by the research institutes. The Minister asked the States to prepare a time-bound plan of action and implement it on priority basis. He also urged the States and the Central Silk Board to provide facilities under various schemes like drip irrigation, bivoltine incentive, rearing house etc. directly to NGOs and Cooperative bodies. Shri Hussain said, State Governments and the CSB should also agree to supply high yielding mulberry planting material to the farmers and if required arrange for training on a regular basis. He also assured the states that there will not be dearth of any kind of support from the Ministry of Textiles. Addressing the Conference the Minister of State for Textiles Shri G.N. Ramachandran said India is the second largest producer of raw silk in the world and the import of silk is also growing. He said, the Central Silk Board has achieved a breakthrough in developing a new variety of mulberry silk which is as good as the Chinese.He said, the CSB has also developed various types of small equipment required. He also asked the states to focus on the neglected areas like Tasar and Eri. The day long conference of Ministers and Secretaries incharge of Sericulture has been concluded coinciding with the Silk Week. The Conference will focus on the problems faced by the sector and draw up a road map to achieve the 10th Plan targets."

218,16-December-2003 19:35 IST,Ministry of Science & Technology,President Kalam dedicates to nation the Brain Research Centre Calls for focus on mentally challenged children Dr. Joshi says NBRC will be turned into world-class institute,"The President, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam has called for a focussed attention on mentally challenged children, while dedicating to the nation the state-of-the-art National Brain Research Centre at Manesar, Haryana today. The NBRC which is a deemed university now, will be turned into a world-class institution said Dr. Murli Manohar Joshi, the Minister for Human Resource Development and Science & Technology in his introductory remarks. Dr. Kalam urged the Centre to see how, we can provide a normal life to the mentally challenged children, whose number has been growing not only in India but also in many developing countries. He called upon the Bio-scientists, Neuro scientists, Medical scientists, Electron experts, IT and communication experts, to jointly strive for finding solutions to brain-disorders that afflict the poor and rich, the male and the female alike irrespective of age. He also called for global participation in a comprehensive project to tackle the problem that is looming large over humanity. Mental health should form part of holistic healthcare, he said. Dr. Joshi said that brain research requires cutting edge technology and most modern infrastructure. Hence, the government took the initiative to set up this centre, with India being a pioneer in brain research and neuro sciences. He said the NBRC’s major efforts will be to coordinate and serve as the Apex Nodal Centre of brain research across universities and institutions throughout the country. Indeed, the current efforts to network 42 institutions in India, is the first step in that direction. Then global networking would follow. Dr. Joshi also pointed out that India has successful, on-going collaborative programmes in brain related disorders with leading institutions of United States, France, Russia and Japan."
219,16-December-2003 20:2 IST,Ministry of Labour & Employment,Wage ceiling for coverage under ESI scheme raised,"The Employees’ State Insurance Corporation at its meeting held at New Delhi this evening decided to enhance the wage ceiling for purpose of coverage of employees under the scheme from the existing Rs.6500/- to Rs.7500/- per month. The new ceiling will come into force shortly. Speaking on the occasion the Union Minister of Labour and Chairman ESIC, Dr. Sahib Singh said that the new wage ceiling will initially remain in force for a period of two years whereafter it would be reviewed for further enhancement. The upward revision of the wage ceiling had become necessary as over 13 lakh employees had gone out of coverage over the last five years due to crossing of the present wage ceiling, the Minister elaborated. On the other hand the exodus of insured employees had resulted in underutilization of infrastructural facilities. Another significant decision taken at today’s meeting was bringing down the threshold for purpose of coverage of factories and establishments to ten employees irrespective of the criterion whether power was being used or not in the manufacturing process. This decision is expected to bring thousands of additional factories and establishments under the purview of the Act and provide for social protection to a sizeable number of additional workers. The Corporation at its meeting today also decided to unbundle the integrated package of social security benefits provided under the scheme and give workers an option to select the need based benefits at a lower rate of contribution. The scheme will be introduced after necessary amendment to the ESI Act. The Corporation also granted relief to the workers in the lowest wage bracket and earning upto Rs.50/- a day by exempting them from payment of their share of ESI contribution. The exempted employees will, however, be entitled to all social security benefits under the scheme."

221,17-December-2003 12:25 IST,Ministry of Defence,Purchase of Laser Guidance Kits/penetration bombs,"RAJYA SABHA Comptroller and Auditor General observed that the cost of procurement of Laser Guidance Kits in 1999 was higher as compared to figures arrived at by escalating the last purchase price using normal escalation factors. A contract was concluded with a foreign vendor in August 1999 for supply of Laser Guidance Kits (LGK) to fill up War Wastage Reserve (WWR) deficiencies as per approved scales and the prescribed procedure. The cost was higher because the proposals entailed supply of additional items, which were not separately priced in the contract, as well as a faster delivery schedule, etc. These LG kits were procured for General Purpose 1000 lbs Bombs. However, since these kits can be fitted to PB-500 Deep Penetration Bombs also, it was subsequently decided to procure these Deep Penetration Bombs too. Since bombs complementary to the LGKs were always available, question of reduction of shelf life of these kits due to mismatch with bombs does not arise. The urgency of procurement of LGK was based on the requirements to fill up the then existing deficiency in the War Wastage Reserve. Appropriate action has been taken on the report and comments have been sent to the Office of Principal Director of Audit Defence Services (Air Force & Navy) This information was given by the Defence Minister Shri George Fernandes in a written reply to Shri Murli Deora in Rajya Sabha today."

238,17-December-2003 14:14 IST,Ministry of Science & Technology,AICTE discontinues MoU system,"The All India Council for Technical Education has decided to discontinue with the system of MoU in the interest of the stakeholders of technical education. This follows the failure of the system to serve the purpose it was intended for. A number of problems cropped up in the smooth functioning of the AICTE, due to indifferent attitude of the Council of Architecture (CoA). An Mou was signed with the CoA only to facilitate visits of Expert Committee to the Architectural Institutions by it and nothing else. This too was done by the AICTE by delegating its authority of inspecting institutions to the CoA through an MoU. But it was found that the CoA was failing in its duty to meet the obligations fully under the MoU and was rather creating hurdles in the functioning of AICTE and Architectural Institutions, which were not in the interest of technical education. This was purely an administrative arrangement for better coordination of activities concerning technical education. Since the MoU was entered into, without any legislative action, its termination also did not require any such action and in all cases the final decision always rested with the AICTE under the latest act i.e. AICTE Act 1987. No legislative powers can be vested with any Authority through an MoU. In the light of the non-cooperation of CoA, the AICTE Executive Committee while reviewing the MoU recently, decided to do away with the system and carry out its own functions as per the mandate given in the act. Henceforth the CoA will only act as per the manner provided in the CoA act."

246,17-December-2003 17:18 IST,Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers,Consultative Committee of Chemicals & Fertilizers Ministry meets,"The meeting of the consultative Committee of Members of Parliament attached to the Ministry of Chemical and Fertilizers was held at parliament House Annexe here this morning. Initiating the discussion, Minister of Chemical and Fertilizers Shri Sukhdev singh Dhindsa highlighted the role that chemical fertilizers have played during the post independence period in achieving self-reliance in foodgrain production in the country. He said the contribution of chemical fertilizers in increasing production and productivity in agriculture sector cannot be undermined. The Minister said the policy of the Government has been aimed not only to achieve maximum possible degree of self-sufficiency in production of Nitrogenous and Phosphatic fertilizers but also to ensure affordability to farmers by fixing uniform selling prices, to be applicable through out the country. Our country has today become the third largest producer in the world by producing about 146 lakh MT of N&P in nutrient terms. He said while India has achieved near self-sufficiency in production capacity of urea, in case of DAP and complexes, their installed capacity has bypassed the current level of domestic requirement. However, to meet the requirement of potash, the country will continue to depend entirely on import in the absence of its own reserves. Referring to the last month’s reports of inadequate availability of DAP from States like UP, MP and Punjab he said due to timely intervention by the Department, adequate availability was ensured in those areas. Department of Fertilizers is continuously in touch with all the State Governments so as to ensure timely and adequate supply of the major fertilizers for meeting their total requirement. Shri Dhindsa said that in order to further capacity addition in the urea sector, the department is currently in the process of seeking approval of the Government on the pricing policy for investment to be made in new and expansion projects of urea as well as existing non-gas based urea units converting to natural gas and LNG for feedstock. With this policy, he said, some more projects other than the expansion project of KRIBHCO, which is already under active consideration, will come up. Joint venture project in Oman having an annual production capacity of 16.5 lakh MT of urea is likely to be commissioned in June-July 2005. Over and above, Namrup revamp is also under advanced stage of implementation. With these projects, it is hoped that by the end of 10th Five year Plan, the production capacity of urea would be sufficient enough to meet the country’s entire requirement. Similarly, production capacity of DAP along with a reasonable mix of import, will be adequate to meet the country’s demand by the end of this plan period. He said the Department is formulating a revised policy for indigenous DAP and imported DAP and MOP based on Tariff Commission’s Report. Over and above, as stated earlier, for bridging the gap between the demand and supply of urea in the mid term scenario, the Government is in the process of formulating a policy for new and expansion of urea units, debottlenecking leading to higher capacity and conversion of existing costlier feedstock units to gas and LNG based units. The members made various suggestions to improve the production of fertilizers. They also emphasized the need to promote eco-friendly bio fertilizers balanced use of nutrients. The Minister of State for Chemical and Fertilizers Dr. Chhatrapal Singh and Members of Parliament S/Shri Chandran Pillay, A.C. Jose, Manoj Bhattacharya and Mohendra Prasad attended the meeting."

248,17-December-2003 17:28 IST,Prime Minister's Office,PM’s statement in Lok Sabha on the need for a financial package to Bihar for developmental works,"Following is the text of the statement of the Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee on the subject of need for a financial package to Bihar for developmental works in the state, in Lok Sabha today: ""I learnt about the concerns expressed by the Hon’ble Members about the development problems of Bihar and I am here to assure you that the issue of effectively addressing the problem of poverty and backwardness of some regions, including Bihar has been engaging our attention and we have initiated the Rashtriya Sam Vikas Yojana (RSVY) in the Tenth Five Year Plan which has a special economic package for Bihar. Under this plan, projects in critical sectors requiring intervention have been identified and full central assistance will be given for their implementation. As you are aware, Central Assistance is being given to fund the State Plans as per the Gadgil-Mukherji formula under which 85% weightage is given to population and per capita income, which helps states like Bihar. Besides, Additional Central Assistance is also given for a number of identified programmes and special projects to finance the state plans. As a matter of fact, 83% of the plan outlay of Bihar of Rs.3320 crore for the current year is financed by central assistance. Now, I would like to elaborate on the efforts being made by the Union government for development of critical sectors in Bihar to which the Hon’ble members have drawn the attention of the House. Roads Out of 3408 km of National Highways in Bihar, 723 km is included for development of 4-lanes under the National Highway development Project. It includes 206 km of NH No.2 under Golden Quadrilateral and 517 km length of East-West corridor. The balance is being developed through the State Government and other agencies. A special project to upgrade and strengthen the State Highways is being funded under the RSVY. Improvement of Major District Roads/Other District Roads will be taken up under Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) of NABARD. Rural roads are to be upgraded using Prime Minister’s Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) funds. An amount of Rs.150 crore is allocated to Bihar per annum for development of rural roads under PMGSY. Unfortunately, no funds could be released in 2002-03 due to poor pace of expenditure by the State Government. Power At present, most of the requirement of power of Bihar is being met from the Central utilities. Further, the NTPC is planning to take up three mega projects in Bihar with an aggregate capacity of 4480 MW at an estimated cost of about Rs.18,700 crore during the Xth/XIth Plan periods. Besides, surplus power from the hydel projects of the North East will also be available for the region. It is not the availability of power which is problematic, but the capacity of Bihar to absorb more. Therefore, a project for strengthening the sub-transmission system in the State at a cost of Rs.365 crore is being taken up under the RSVY. Further, schemes for improvement of distribution infrastructure costing Rs.765 crore have been finalized under the Accelerated Power Development and Reforms Programme (APDRP) for completion within two years. With this investment, Bihar state would be able to utilize more power and improve its economy. Some members have mentioned about low Plant Load Factor (PLF) of state run power stations. NTPC is willing to take over Muzaffarpur power station, invest on its modernization and improve the PLF if the State Government agrees. Irrigation and Floods Although irrigation and flood control are state subjects, the Central Government has been alive to the problem and assisting the state through various schemes. Keeping in view the flood problems of North Bihar on account of rivers like Kamla, Bagmati and Kosi emanating from Nepal, the Government of India has already reached an agreement with Nepal for taking up investigations and project-report-preparation for construction of storages on Sapta Kosi and Sun Kosi. Discussions are going on for similar projects on the other two rivers also. The Central Government has also sanctioned four schemes in the flood-control sector for maintenance of Kosi and Gandak embankments, flood-proofing, extension of embankments into Nepal territory and anti-erosion works. It is for the State Government to take advantage of these schemes and utilise the available funds fully. Under the Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme, the Central Government has already approved seven projects to create an additional irrigation potential of about three lakh hectares. The drawals by the State Government in the last two years, however, have been far short of the ceilings fixed. The State Government should utilize the allocated funds fully for completion of the on-going projects. The Central Government has also agreed to fully fund the project for restoration of Eastern Gandak canal system at a cost of Rs.294 crore under the RSVY. This project will restore an irrigation potential of about 3.5 lakh hectares lost due to siltation and dilapidation of the canal system. A programme for installation of a million shallow tubewells to irrigate two million hectares is being taken up under the RSVY. I am told that by the end of this year, one lakh tubewells will be installed. I am sure, this programme will benefit millions of farmers of Bihar to improve their income from agriculture. Special projects for development of Mango, Lichi, Makhana crops and Spices in four districts of Bihar to improve its horticultural economy is being taken up. Railways Thirteen projects for construction of new lines, ten for gauge conversion, fifteen for doubling of lines and two for electrification have been taken up in Bihar. Rashtriya Sam Vikas Yojana (RSVY) Under this programme, the following projects worth Rs.2531.35 crore have been identified for implementation during the 10th Plan: Name of Projects Crore Rupees 1. Million Shallow Tubewell Programme (Subsidy Component) 578.28 2. Strengthening of Sub-transmission system in Bihar 365.00 3. Development of State Highways in Bihar 846.29 4. Restoration of Eastern Gandak Canal 294.00 5. Development of Horticulture (Subsidy Component) 36.78 6. Integrated Forest Management 351.00 7. Integrated Watershed Development 60.00 TOTAL 2531.35 Let me assure you that as committed by the Planning Commission, overriding priority will be given to the implementation of these projects which have been identified after wide-ranging consultations and there will not be any constraint of funds. Central assistance at the rate of Rs.1000 crore per year will be made available during the 10th Plan subject to actual utilisation. Central agencies will be involved in the timely implementation of projects. Under the Backward Districts Initiative, eight districts of Bihar, affected by extremism, have been included. These districts will receive grant at the rate of Rs.15 crore each per year for three years. My attention has been drawn to the exclusion of Bihar and Orissa from the normal component of this Initiative. I would like to assure all of you that eligible districts of these two States will also be covered under the programme. Thus, a multi-pronged effort is being made to address the development problems of Bihar. However, the Hon’ble Members will agree with me that successful project implementation requires conducive environment, effective administration and quick decision making from all concerned. The State Government needs to gear up its machinery for timely completion of projects so that the funds allocated to the State under various schemes are utilized and the intended benefits flow to the State and the ultimate beneficiaries. With the joint efforts of the State and the Central Government, I am hopeful that the initiative taken through the special Plan under the Rashtriya Sam Vikas Yojana will help trigger the development process in the State."

250,17-December-2003 17:47 IST,Ministry of Power,"Hydel Power Delvelopment Policy, 1998","RAJYA SABHAShri Anant G. Geete, Minister of Power, informed the Rajya Sabha while replying to a question on Hydel Power Development Policy, formulated in the year 1998 that under this Policy, small hydel projects upto a capacity of 25 MW were transferred to the Ministry of Non-Conventional Energy Sources (MNES) to provide greater thrust for its development. As per information provided by MNES, there is an estimated potential of about 15,000 MW in the country from Small Hydel Projects (SHP) upto 25 MW station capacity. So far, 4,233 small hydel potential sites aggregating about 10,324 MW capacity have been identified. A total number of 466 SHP projects (upto 25 MW) with aggregate capacity of 1,530 MW has been set up which include 339 MW capacity commissioned after 1.4.1998. Similarly, 196 projects aggregating to about 610 MW are presently under construction. Referring to the policy Shri Geete said that with a view to accelerating the pace of hydro-electric power development in the country, the Government formulated the Policy on Hydro Power Development in 1998. The aim of the policy is to initiate measures to check the declining trend in the share of hydro in the overall energy generation in the country and to exploit the large hydroelectric potential available, especially in the North and North-Eastern region. The objectives of the policy inter-alia include promotion of small and mini hydel projects. The small and mini hydel potential can provide a solution for the energy problems in remote and hilly areas where extension of the grid system is comparatively uneconomical and also along the canal systems. Small hydro projects can be developed in a shorter timeframe as well as with a lower capital investment. They also involve fewer environment and rehabilitation and resettlement problems. In reply to another question Smt. Jayawanti Mehta, Minister of State for Power, informed the House in a written reply that through a process of countrywide consultation, 162 hydro-electric schemes with an estimated capacity of 50,560 MW have been identified for preparation of feasibility studies. This initiative for tapping 50,000 MW of hydro power was launched by the Prime Minister on May 24, 2003 and will pave the way for the creation of a shelf of projects which will be implemented in the next two Five Year Plans. This exercise is being undertaken by various organisations under the overall coordination of Central Electricity Authority."

273,18-December-2003 13:45 IST,Ministry of Science & Technology,BARC develops new wound healing technique,"The Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) has just developed a new wound healing technique called “Hydrogel Wound Dressing”. This is highly useful for burns, leprosy ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, animal bites, plastic surgery etc. The treatment based on this methodology is also known as “Moist Would Healing”, and is a well established practice in Europe, America and other developed countries. No such dressing was manufactured in India until recently and the imported ones were very expensive. Even in developed countries such healing techniques are very costly. But the product developed by BARC, using radiation processing is very cost-effective. The BARC has transferred this technology to the industry for commercialisation and the product is now available in the market. Radiation technology finds varied applications in the field of industry, healthcare, agriculture and research. India is a leading producer of radioisotopes in the world. Radioisotopes are produced at the research reactors Apsara, CIRUS and Dhruva at Trombay. The first indigenous cobalt-60 tele-therapy source was prepared for use in treatment of cancer.

Transgenic lines developed in different crop species by ICAR institutions, several other institutes and the private sector are under various stages of development or testing in the country. Advances have been made at the ICAR experimentation plots in transgenic potato in terms of improved nutritional quality and balanced amino acid composition. Indigenously developed Bt detection kits by the ICAR have proved effective. The Agriculture Minister stressed the need to develop a suitable capacity building programme and also a human resource development project to cater to research and development needs in the country in respect of agro-biotechnological applications. In addition to enriching bio-technology laboratories of the ICAR system, bio-technology laboratories in various State Agricultural Universities also need to be strengthened. Shri Rajnath Singh said that bio-technology applications in general and transgenics in particular offer new opportunities in agriculture to increase production and productivity. It is imperative to assess the potential role and requirement for promotion and regulation of transgenics for their fruitful utilization in Indian agriculture. The Minister emphasised that farmers’ acceptance coupled with farm prosperity is the foremost guiding principle for release of transgenic crop varieties. The release of these varieties should be based not only on their environment and biosafety clearance, but also on their coordinated value for cultivation and use. The Agriculture Minister also stressed the need to promote public awareness in matters relating to agricultural bio-technology. He also called for giving priority to isolation of indigenous genes. He cautioned that post release monitoring and management of transgenics and their products is essential. Participating in the deliberations, the members appreciated the tremendous scope for increase in agricultural production through transgenics. They suggested extensive discussion with the State Governments to ensure smooth application of transgenics. The Members also stressed the need for proper assessment of risk factors involved in transgenics. The need for proper communication between scientists and farmers was also highlighted. Some members suggested identification of certain areas for propagating transgenic crops. The global area under the genetically modified (GM) crop varieties increased to 58.7 million hectares in 2002. The principal biotech crops were soyabean, corn, cotton and canola. In India, the environmental release of transgenics Bt cotton hybrids in 2002 heralded a new era with 3 transgenic cotton hybrids namely, MECH-184, MECH-162 and MECH-12 being approved for cultivation. In India, assessment of transgenics for environmental and bio-safety criteria and release for commercialization is carried out under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The Ministry of Environment and Forests is the nodal ministry responsible for environmental release of genetically modified organisms including transgenic crops. The Genetic Engineering Approval Committee accords approval for or rejects applications for the release of transgenics for commercialization after due deliberation. Today’s meeting was attended by S/shri Bhartruhari Mahtab, Chunni Lal Bhau Thakur, Mahboob Zahedi, K.Sreenivasulu, K.P.Singh Deo, Haribhai Choudhary and Anadi Charan Sahu, all from the Lok Sabha."
275,18-December-2003 15:22 IST,Ministry of Commerce & Industry,Industry poised for era of sustained high growthJAITLEY PRESIDES OVER PARLIAMENTARY CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY,"Indian economy is poised to grow at over 7% in terms of real GDP during 2003-04, with industrial growth and manufacturing growth, in particular, having reached a stage where all the ingredients are in place to trigger an era of sustained high growth. The overall investment climate today is conducive to promoting growth and investment in industry as reflected in buoyant investment indicators. This was indicated in a presentation on the “Present Industrial Scenario” at a meeting of the Parliamentary Consultative Committee of the Ministry of Commerce & Industry, which was presided over by Shri Arun Jaitley, Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and attended by Shri Suresh P. Prabhu, MP (Shiv Sena); Shri Kapil Sibal, MP (INC); Shri M. Master Mathan, MP (BJP); and others. Shri Dipak Chatterjee, Commerce Secretary and Shri Lakshmi Chand, Secretary (Industrial Policy & Promotion) were present. On the external front, the country’s foreign exchange reserves continue to surge and have now exceeded US $ 96 billion. Healthy growth in imports may also have a favourable impact on industry in the coming months, while surge in non-oil imports (in April-October 2003) reflects strengthening of domestic demand. Over the same period, export growth in dollar terms has been sustained, although at a slower pace compared to high base of the previous year. However, improved prospects for global recovery should provide a fresh impetus to export growth, it was indicated. Members present stressed the need to increase the share of manufacturing in GDP to generate greater employment opportunities, especially in rural areas. Apart from the contribution of services to GDP and its expanding growth in the country’s overall growth process, it was mentioned that employment generation would come essentially through the manufacturing, mining and construction sectors. Fortunately, construction activity was looking up as also steel and cement and these were positive signals. The importance of manufacturing was brought out in the presentation which said that in India it currently accounted for about 17% of real (measured) GDP, 12% of the total workforce and 24% of the total workforce engaged in the organised sector, and little less than three-fourth of India’s total merchandise exports. “The combination of low inflation, low interest rates, tax buoyancy and the revival of public spending on infrastructure together signal a very high likelihood of a significant acceleration in overall growth and industrial growth, in particular”, it said. The discussions also briefly touched upon the performance and progress of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) in the country. It was mentioned that SEZs in the first six months of the current financial year (April-September 2003) registered an export growth of 23% as against around 10% for the non-SEZ sector. Members emphasised the need for having the SEZ Act in place early, as a proper regulatory framework was needed to attract investment in the zones and facilitate faster implementation of the SEZ scheme."

280,18-December-2003 16:52 IST,Ministry of Rural Development,`Jal Samvardhan Yojana’ for rainwater harvesting on the anvil,"Ministry of Rural Development proposes to launch `Jal Samvardhan Yojana’ for rainwater harvesting shortly. This was informed by Shri Kashiram Rana Union Minister for Rural Development, here today. Shri Rana said that the annual allocation of the scheme would be about Rs. 1000 crore. Modalities are being worked out for the scheme. Our country is facing water problem not because we do not have adequate sources of water. The problem lies in our inability to conserve all the rainwater. Most of the rain water flows into the seas without being harnessed. Therefore, revival, renovation and maintenance of all the available sources of water is the need of the hour, Shri Rana said. Shri Rana highlighted that the Ministry of Rural Development places special emphasis on monitoring and evaluation of its programme being implemented in rural areas all over the country. The success of the programmes largely depends at the effective delivery system, proper utilisation of funds and efficient implementation of the grass-root levels. Shri Rana said that the role of media is especially significant in the context of implementation of various rural development programmes. Media can play effective role in creating awareness amongst the target groups of the programme and mobilise them towards participatory development. Shri Rana released annual edition of Gramin Bharat (Hindi fortnightly) here today. Shri Annasaheb.M.K.Patil and Shri U.V. Krishnam Raju, Ministers of State for Rural Development were also present there. Talking to the media, Shri Rana informed that in order to ensure capacity building of the Panchayati Raj functionaries by providing easy access to information on Rural Development Programmes, in April, 2002, the Ministry of Rural Development started publication of monthly news letter titled`Grameen Bharat’. The newsletter is being published in Hindi, English and eleven Regional languages and distributed free of cost to all the Panchayats in the country. The newsletter serves not only as a unilinear vehicle to communicate messages and information on rural development programmes but also as a reliable source of getting feedback on the implementation of the programmes at the field level in the form of responses from the readers."

Here is the text of Dr. Jatiya’s statement :- ""As per article 366 (24) of the Constitution, ""’Scheduled Castes,’ means such castes, races or tribes or parts of or groups within such castes, races or tribes as are deemed under article 341 to be Scheduled Castes for the purpose of this Constitution."" Clause (1) of Article 341 of the Constitution provides that ""The President may with respect to any State or Union Territory, and where it is a State, after consultation with the Governor thereof, by public notification, specify the castes, races or tribes or parts of a groups within castes, races or tribes, which shall for the purpose of this Constitution be deemed to be Scheduled Castes in relation to that State or Union Territory as the case may be"". Further, Clause (2) of Article 341 of the Constitution provides that ""Parliament may be law include in or exclude from the list of Scheduled Castes specified in a notification issued under clause (1) any caste, race or tribe or part of or group within any caste, race or tribe, but save as aforesaid a notification issued under the said clause shall not be varied by any subsequent notification. The test applied for inclusion in the list of Scheduled Castes is ‘extreme social, educational and economic backwardness arising out of the traditional practice of untouchability."" Para 3 of the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order 1950 includes, only the Hindu, the Sikh and the Buddhist religions. Thereby persons belonging to these religions are eligible to be included in the list of Scheduled Castes, if they fulfill the conditions laid down in the said Constitutional Order. The validity of paragraph 3 of the Presidential Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 was considered by the Supreme Court in the case of Soosai etc. vs. the Union of India and others (Writ petition No.9596 of 1983), wherein Apex Court observed, in para 7 of the judgement that, ""Now it can not be disputed that the caste system is a feature of the Hindu social structure. It is a social phenomenon peculiar to Hindu society. The division of the Hindu social order by reference at one time to professional or vocational occupation was moduled into a structural hierarchy, which over the centuries crystallized into stratification where the place of the individual was determined by birth. Those who occupied the lowest rung of the social ladder were treated as existing beyond the periphery of civilized society, and were indeed not even ""touchable"". This social attitude committed those castes to severe social and economic disabilities and cultural and educational backwardness, The Apex Court in para 8 of their Judgement further observed that, ""It is quite evident that President had before him all this material indicating that the depressed classes of Hindu and Sikh communities suffered from economic and social disabilities and cultural and educational backwardness so gross in character and degree that the members of those castes in the two communities called for the protection of the Constitutional provision relating to the Scheduled Castes. It was evident that in order to provide for their amelioration and advancement it was necessary to conceive of intervention by the State through its legislative and executive powers. It must be remembered that the declaration incorporated in paragraph 3 deeming them to be members of the Scheduled Castes was a declaration made for the purpose of the Constitution. It was a declaration enjoined by Clause (1) of Article 341 of the Constitution."" The Apex court in para 8 of the Judgement concluded thus, ""It is therefore, not possible to say that the President acted arbitrarily in the exercise of his judgement in enacting paragraph 3 of the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950"". It is alleged that the ""Dalit "" Muslims were getting benefits as are available to Scheduled Castes during the period 1935-50 and the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 has debarred them from getting such benefits. It is clarified that there is no record available which shows that ""Dalit"" Muslims are getting benefits as are available to Scheduled Castes during the period 1935-50. It is contained in the Report of the Advisory Committee on the Revision of the lists of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, Government of India, "" The relevant record shows in drawing the list of Scheduled Castes, the test applied was the social, educational and economic backwardness arising out of the historical customs of untoucahbility. The list of Scheduled castes drawn in 1950 was a revised version of the list of Scheduled Castes under the Government of India Act, 1935, which, in turn was the continuation of earlier list of depressed classes. The depressed classes, it is well known were systematically categorized in 1931 by the Census Commissioner of India, who had given the following instructions for the categorization :- ""I have explained depressed castes as castes, contact with whom entails purification on part of high caste Hindus. It is not intended that the term should have any reference to occupation as such but to those castes which by reasons of their traditional position in Hindu society are denied access to temples for instance or have to use separate wells or are not allowed to sit inside school house but have to remain outside or suffer similar disabilities."" Thus it is clear that ""Dalit"" Muslims or ""Dalit"" Christians were not included in the list of Depressed Classes during the period 1935-50. The issue of inclusion of Scheduled Castes convert to Christianity in the list of Scheduled Castes has been processed in consultation with the Registrar General of India and the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The Registrar General of India has opined that stratification among Christians on the basis of caste could well become a matter of international controversy and it may be misunderstood internationally as if India is imposing its caste system among Christians and that such reservation is not justifiable. The National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes have opined that the inclusion of `Dalit’ Christians in the list of Scheduled Castes for the purpose of reservation is neither desirable nor justifiable. Similarly in the case of inclusion of Scheduled Castes converted to Islam, the Registrar General of India has opined that it will be a serious controversy and also discontentment among the Muslims, if their community is recognised at par with those of Hindu castes on the ground of backwardness arising due to the traditional practice of untouchability, especially for the purpose of Article 341 of the Constitution of India. In this regard, the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes has opined that there is no justification for the proposal to add Muslims in the list of Scheduled Castes. For inclusion in the list of Scheduled Tribes there is no bar on religious grounds. """

The depressed classes, it is well known were systematically categorized in 1931 by the Census Commissioner of India, who had given the following instructions for the categorization :- ""I have explained depressed castes as castes, contact with whom entails purification on part of high caste Hindus. It is not intended that the term should have any reference to occupation as such but to those castes which by reasons of their traditional position in Hindu society are denied access to temples for instance or have to use separate wells or are not allowed to sit inside school house but have to remain outside or suffer similar disabilities."" Thus it is clear that ""Dalit"" Muslims or ""Dalit"" Christians were not included in the list of Depressed Classes during the period 1935-50. The issue of inclusion of Scheduled Castes convert to Christianity in the list of Scheduled Castes has been processed in consultation with the Registrar General of India and the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The Registrar General of India has opined that stratification among Christians on the basis of caste could well become a matter of international controversy and it may be misunderstood internationally as if India is imposing its caste system among Christians and that such reservation is not justifiable. The National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes have opined that the inclusion of `Dalit’ Christians in the list of Scheduled Castes for the purpose of reservation is neither desirable nor justifiable. Similarly in the case of inclusion of Scheduled Castes converted to Islam, the Registrar General of India has opined that it will be a serious controversy and also discontentment among the Muslims, if their community is recognised at par with those of Hindu castes on the ground of backwardness arising due to the traditional practice of untouchability, especially for the purpose of Article 341 of the Constitution of India. In this regard, the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes has opined that there is no justification for the proposal to add Muslims in the list of Scheduled Castes. For inclusion in the list of Scheduled Tribes there is no bar on religious grounds. """

289,02-December-2003 18:23 IST,Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment,Independence struggle and fight for social equality are of equal importance says the Prime Minister,"The Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee has underlined that the issue of Social equality and our struggle for Independence are Complementary. There is no question of comparing one with the other. Those who fought for freedom and those who worked for ensuring social equality deserve equal importance and place in our history. Dedicating to the nation Baba Saheb Dr. Ambedkar’s Parivirvan Sthal here today, Shri Vajpayee said that Baba Saheb Dr. Ambedkar believed that battle for independence and social equality have to be fought on equal footing. Describing Gandhiji and Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar as great leaders, the Prime Minister said that the two should not be compared with eachother as both had immense contribution to the struggle for freedom of the country and for equality in Indian Society. Lauding Baba Saheb Dr. Ambedkar’s contribution to post-independent India the Prime Minister said that he ably steered the framing of the Indian Constitution which became a beacon for emerging nations. Shri Vajpayee said that the 26 Alipur Road permises is a pious place as Baba Saheb lived here from 1st November, 1951 to 6th December, 1956 when he breathed his last. The Prime Minister, who also inaugurated the development work of the Dr. Ambedkar National Memorial, said that it would be developed into a Museum that would inspire the people for social equality. He said that Baba Saheb’s Collected Works should be made available to people in all Indian languages. The Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment Dr. Satyanarayan Jatiya said that the dedication to nation of Baba Saheb Dr. Ambedkar’s Parinirvan Sthal meets the long due demand for a national memorial. He thanked the Union Urban Development Ministry and Delhi Administration for their help in setting up of the memorial. He said that the Collected Works of Baba Saheb have been translated into 11 Indian languages so far. The function was attended among others by the Minister of State (I.C) Shri Bhandaru Datatarya, Lt. Governor of Delhi Vijay Kapoor, Delhi Chief Minister Smt. Sheela Dixit, Minister of State for Sports, Shri Vijay Goel, Minister of State for Food Processing Shri Sang Priya Gautam and Minister of State for Communications Shri Ashok Pradhan.

Later the property had been taken over by an industrial house. In pursuance of the decision of the Centenary Celebrations Committee of Dr. Ambedkar, to set up a suitable National Memorial, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment started the process of acquiring the site from its owners. After undergoing several legal procedures, finally on 14th October, 2003, the execution of exchange deed took place between the Ministry of Urban Development and its owners in the presence of Dr. Satyanarayan Jatiya. The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment will now hand over the land to the Ambedkar Foundation to set up Dr, Ambedkar National Memorial which is long cherished project of the Foundation."
290,02-December-2003 18:24 IST,Ministry of Agriculture,India asks developed countries to reduce domestic support to agriculture,"India has called upon the developed countries to effect a substantial and real reduction in the domestic support, provided by them to their agriculture. Addressing the thirty-second session of the Conference of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in Rome today, the Agriculture Minister Shri Rajnath Singh also called for a genuine differential treatment to the developing countries to address their special concerns. He warned that any agreement on agriculture which does not take care of the concerns of small and marginal farmers in the developing countries would endanger their livelihood and food security. The Minister expressed disappointment over the outcome of the WTO Ministerial Conference at Cancun and regretted that adequate cognizance had not been taken of the interests of farmers, particularly small landholders in the developing countries. Shri Rajnath Singh pointed out that in globalized agriculture, domestic market prices for agricultural products are largely governed by prevailing prices in the international market. International prices of almost all agricultural commodities are distorted on account of huge domestic support and export subsidies provided by the developed countries to their agriculture. Due to these subsidies, the international prices get depressed and competitiveness of farmers in countries like India gets adversely affected, threatening their livelihood. Due to resource constraints, the developing countries cannot match the subsidies provided by the developed countries to their farmers. The only option available to these countries is to provide protection to their farmers through the mechanism of tariff. The Minister informed the Conference about India’s experience in managing last year’s unprecedented drought, which affected over 300 million people. Nearly a billion mandays were generated in eight months and nine million tons of food grains were distributed. Interventions were made for provision of drinking water, cattle care and movement of food grains, entailing an expenditure of more than 4 billion US dollars. India could tackle the adversity, largely due to its self-sufficiency in agricultural production. Shri Rajnath Singh said that India has put added emphasis on developing watersheds as units of crop diversification and development of horticulture to ensure sustained development of agriculture. Shri Rajnath Singh pledged India’s continued support to the FAO in achieving its objective of global food and nutritional security and raising the standards of living of farmers. The 12-day FAO Conference began on the 29th of last month. It is being attended by Agriculture Ministers from around the world."

298,02-December-2003 18:36 IST,Ministry of Commerce & Industry,India wins GSP case against EC at the WTO,"A WTO dispute settlement panel established at India’s request in January 2003 has upheld India’s contention that the European Communities has violated its GATT/WTO obligations in granting tariff preferences to 12 countries under the “Drug Arrangements” window of its GSP scheme without extending these preferences to other developing countries. The Panel has also ruled that the EC has failed to demonstrate that the Drug Arrangements are justified under the Enabling Clause, which otherwise allows the developed countries to grant tariff preferences to developing countries without allowing the same advantage to developed countries. India would seek the adoption of the panel report at the earliest in accordance with the provisions of the Dispute Settlement Understanding. Disputing parties in the WTO have a right to appeal a decision of the panel to the Appellate Body. This WTO ruling is likely to provide some relief to the Indian exporters to EC, particularly those in the apparel sector, who are otherwise disadvantaged by duty concessions to Pakistan under the Drug Arrangements. India’s dispute with EC had arisen primarily because EC included Pakistan as beneficiary country under its Special Tariff Arrangement for Combating Drug Production and Trafficking under its GSP Scheme for the years 2002-04. Such a scheme was in operation even in earlier years with beneficiaries being restricted to ANDEAN and Central American countries. While the scheme, in India’s view was not compatible with WTO rules even then, it had not agitated the matter in WTO since it was not significantly affected. However, with the inclusion of Pakistan as a beneficiary country with effect from 1.1.2002, Indian exports were directly affected, since there are a number of export sectors such as clothing where the two countries are close competitors in the EC market. The sudden and significant (a 9.6 % tariff preference for instance on certain apparel products) advantage granted to Pakistani products has disadvantaged a significant level of trade flowing from India to EC. India invoked dispute settlement proceedings of the WTO in this case with extreme reluctance and after having exhausted all available avenues for a negotiated settlement with the EC. The matter was taken up repeatedly with the EC at various levels including at the ministerial level. Even after initiating the dispute under WTO’s dispute settlement procedures in March 2002, India continued its effort in seeking a bilateral solution to the problem with EC. However at no stage did EC respond positively to India’s concerns. India continued these efforts even after the panel proceedings were at an advanced stage. During the panel proceedings India also clarified that while it did not dispute EC’s right to give financial assistance to individual developing countries facing problems relating to drug production and trafficking, this could not be done at the expense of other developing countries facing different but equally pressing needs. India also urged EC to obtain a WTO waiver for these arrangements through prescribed procedures under the WTO Agreement. Certain other beneficiaries of the Drug Arrangements implored EC to seek a waiver. However, EC insisted on continuing the dispute. The WTO panel has vindicated India’s stand that the tariff preference under the Drug Arrangements are not given unconditionally to all developing countries. The Panel was not convinced by EC’s contention that the Drug Arrangements are justified under the Enabling Clause. The Panel found that the EC’s Drug Arrangements, as a GSP scheme, do not provide identical tariff preferences to all developing countries and that the differentiation is neither for the purpose of special treatment to the least-developed countries, nor in the context of the implementation of a priori measures. The panel has recommended that the Dispute Settlement Body requests the EC to bring its measure into conformity with its obligations under GATT. Indian exporters to the EC have suffered considerable loss on account of the 10% tariff concessions available to exports from Pakistan of similar products. They can now hope to obtain some succour after the EC implements the findings of the panel in this dispute."

Functionality wise there is no difference between the two systems, which are basically meant to prevent driver passing signal at danger. However, both the systems use different technologies to achieve the intended functionality. The conventional AWA system uses track magnet, which are basically made of Copper, as track device making it prone to thefts. Information about signal aspect, in AWS, is transmitted from track device to cab equipment through electro magnetic induction. TPWS use Euro Balise as a track device, which is an electronic device with very less copper inside and it uses radio transmission for sending information to cab equipment. TPWS is basically meant to prevent driver from passing a signal at danger thereby preventing accident thereof. The system does not have any functionality, which can curtail outside interference of rail installation, such as track and signal equipment.

335,19-December-2003 16:8 IST,Ministry of Steel,Import facilitation for construction industry,"RAJYA SABHA The Government has examined the representations from the construction industry regarding the adverse impact of increasing steel prices. In a deregulated and liberalized environment, prices are determined by the free interplay of market forces. Nevertheless, as a measure of import facilitation, the Government has removed 33 steel items from the purview of DGFT Notification No. 44 with effect from 28th October, 2003. Inclusion of steel items in the DGFT Notification No. 44 required the exporters of these steel items to India to register themselves with the Bureau of Indian Standards and was being viewed as a non-tariff barrier. Prices of steel items that reached a peak in August 2003 have subsequently stabilised. The recent upswing in steel prices has had the effect of reducing the profit margins of downstream consumer industries. However, the import facilitation as a result of withdrawal of steel items from the purview of DGFT Notification No. 44 has provided the option to downstream steel consumers to source their requirements through imports. Exporters can also avail of the Advance license route for importing their inputs at zero custom duty. This information was given by the Minister for Steel, Shri B.K. Tripathy in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today."
336,19-December-2003 16:9 IST,Ministry of Steel,Disinvestment of Rashtriya Ispat Nigam,"RAJYA SABHA There is a proposal before the Government for disinvesting Rashtriya Ispat Nigam. It is based on the recommendations of Disinvestment Commission contained in its XIIth Report which are as follows :- The entire accumulated losses of the Company of Rs.4,065.30 crores as on 31.03.1999 should be written off by the Government against its entire share money pending allotment and preference share capital and a part of the equity capital to clean up its balance sheet and keep the company from being referred to BIFR; and Simultaneously to initiate process of disinvestment of not less than 51% of its remaining equity holding in RINL to a strategic buyer. In view of the strengths of the plant, the Commission feels the investor interest in acquiring RINL after the balance sheet is cleaned up. The selection of strategic buyer should be done through global competitive bidding by pre-qualification of bidders. Disinvestment Commission has given the following reasons for their above mentioned recommendations:- The Disinvestment Commission classified RINL as non-core and opined that no public purpose would be served by retaining RINL under Government ownership. Steel industry in India is completely decontrolled with the presence of large number of private producers. Imports are freely permitted with declining import duties. Hence, the Steel market is fully contestable not only vis-à-vis Indian producers but also other steel majors in the world. The public sector steel industry in India would, therefore, have to compete in the highly competitive and technology/market driven international steel sector. Since public sector form of management does not allow such flexibility/investments it would be advisable to disinvest majority Government equity in RINL. RINL has distinct advantages of its location, layout, technology and should be an ideal steel plant in India for steel majors in the world to invest in. With proper restructuring the plant can be converted into a 10 million tonne export oriented plant by one of the international steel majors. The next steel upturn is expected in 2002 and plant should be disinvested looking at the time of the next steel upturn. The Disinvestment Commission felt that the company needed substantial financial support from Government of India for financial restructuring and expansion and that as this would involve huge cash outflow from the Government, this would not be justified and is avoidable. It was further of the view that capital expansion in the steel plant would be more expensive in terms of time and money if undertaken while remaining under Government of India control. The turn over and profit/loss of Rashtriya Ispat Nigam during the last four years, year-wise are as under :-(Rs. in crores) Item 1999-2000 2000-01 2001-02 2002-03 Turnover 2973 3436 4081 5059 Net Profit -562 -291.30 -75 521 This information was given by the Minister for Steel, Shri B.K. Tripathy in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today."

Members also supported the recommendations of the sub committee that there should be a judicious application of the guidelines for operation on category II and category III routes on all the operators, so that the burden of uneconomic operation is equally shared failing which Indian Airlines should be compensated for the losses incurred by them in excess of the guidelines as a part of their social commitment. They felt that there is an urgent need to redefine the routes/stations to be covered under categories I, II, III and to ensure a level playing field.

He was addressing the consultative committee meeting attached to the Ministry of Labour today. He further said that there is general acceptance amongst all quarters that there is a need to provide social security to these workers and as well as that a Bill to this effect be introduced in the Parliament. The proposed Bill envisages to regulate the employment and conditions of service of unorganized sector workers and to provide for old age pension, health, safety, social security and welfare and labour protection. The proposed legislation, inter-alia provides for establishment of a Central Unorganized Sector Workers Welfare Board and similar Boards at the State Level, Unorganised Workers’ Welfare Fund both at the Central and State level and formulation of social security/welfare schemes. To provide for social security measures to these workers the ‘Unorganised Workers’ Social Security Scheme, 2003 has been formulated in consultation with the experts and an Actuary and will be applicable to all workers drawing pay/wages/income not more than Rs.6500/- p.m. The Minister informed the meeting that the scheme will be implemented through the Employees Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) which will provide single window service to the workers for all the three components of the Scheme. The EPFO has got a wide network spread all over the country and would be able to implement the scheme with assistance and cooperation of Workers’ Facilitation Centres, the Employees State Insurance Corporation, other Insurance Companies and the Central and State labour machinery, and also the Panchayati Raj Institutions, Self-Help Groups and NGO, etc. The administrative cost for implementing the scheme would be within 1% of the contribution. These measures will go a long way in improving the living and working conditions of the workers in the unorganized sector. The members praised the minister for his excellent work done for this sector. Members also said that with these initiatives, this sector is taking shape. They also expressed the apprehensions in implementing the scheme. The Minister assured them that these will be taken care of. The meeting was attended by Smt. Sushila Saroj, Shri P.

This was stated by Dr. C.P. Thakur , Union Minister for Small Scale Industries and Development of North Eastern Region at the meeting held with the CMD’s of Public Sector Banks regarding lending to Small Scale Sector(SSI) at Udyog Bhavan here today. The meeting was held to discuss the status of credit flow to SSI Sector, the problems coming in the way of realisation of 12% annual growth target for SSI sector , creation of 4.4 million additional jobs during the 10th Five Year Plan and development of clusters which have economies of scale. Dr. C.P. Thakur said that employment generation was a concern of the Prime Minister also. A target of creation of additional 4.4 million jobs in SSI sector during the 10th five year plan with an annual growth of 12% for SSI sector has been fixed. Employment generation will mainly depend on small-scale sector, hence facilities should be given to them to compete with MNCs. There should be easy and cheap availability of credit to SSI, increase of risk taking by banks, increase in awareness about facilities and incentives to SSIs at branch level and facilitation of the problems of women entrepreneurs for SSI growth. Dr. C.P.Thakur said that labour laws should be abolished for small-scale sector which at present are a great hindrance in its growth. A Single window for SSI should be introduced. He said that banks should lend to small-scale sector at a rate not greater than their Prime Lending Rate (PLR). He also said that regional imbalances in growth have become huge. A meeting of bankers, Chief Ministers of states of West Bengal, Bihar, Eastern U.P. , Orissa and North East with the Minister will soon be called to sort out the problem of regional imbalance. The unanimous decision at the meeting was that there was no dearth of money in banking system for SSI lending . Dr. C.P. Thakur said that this attitudinal change of banks towards SSI was a heartening factor. In absolute terms the flow of SSI sector increased by over Rs. 3000 crores during 2002-2003. However, the share of credit to SSI sector as a percentage of net bank credit has declined to 11.1% in March 2003 which needs to be addressed. To improve the flow of credit the Minister suggested to fix a sub-target of 15% of Net Bank Credit within priority sector for SSI on the pattern of agriculture, to project for 15% annual growth in SSI credit at each bank level and to earmark 10% of incremental bank advances to SSI sector. There is a need to evolve a Uniform Scoring Model for banks to facilitate quick decisions on loan applications. This will ensure transparency in the processing of loan applications. The increase of limit for small-scale sector from Rs. one crore to three crores also came up for discussion. For increased awareness of facilities available to SSI sector,the charter available in banks should be displayed at prominent places. There is a need to publish the charter in English, Hindi as well as regional languages for greater dissemination of facilities available. The minister also said that the same principle of NPAs as applied to large industrial houses should not be applied to tiny units. Credit guarantee scheme should also be strengthened for improvement in SSI . Dr. C.P.Thakur said that banks have to play a very eminent role in the progress of the country. The employment scenario of the country will depend on how much the SSI sector is pushed towards growth in the next five years, he said."

Speaking at the meeting held here late yesterday evening, Shri Geete said that the work on the Mejia project is set to commence soon on receipt of environmental clearance. Other projects of the Corporation are in the tendering stage. In respect of the Maithon Right Bank Project which suffered a set back due to the exit of BSES, DVC has now taken over the project as its subsidiary. Shri Geete emphasised these capacity addition projects are primarily oriented towards export of power to the deficit region in the country. Presently, DVC has reached a generation capacity of 2761.5 MW starting with a small capacity in 1953. DVC is the first Multi-Purpose River of its kind which was set up as a Joint Venture of State of Bihar, West Bengal and the Union Government on the pattern of Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) of USA. The Corporation was expected to help tame the turbulent Damodar River and contribute to the growth of the valley.

348,19-December-2003 17:51 IST,Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas,Rs.8 crore plant to convert plastic waste into hydrocarbon proposed at Nagpur INITIATIVES UNDER WAY TO HARNESS ALTERNATIVE SOURCES FOR AUTO FUELS: RAM NAIK,"Shri Ram Naik, Minister of Petroleum & Natural Gas, informed the Parliamentary Consultative Committee last evening that a proposal has been drawn up for setting up of 5 tonne plant at Nagpur at a cost of about Rs. 8 crore to convert plastic waste into value-added hydrocarbon products. In a statement circulated at the meeting Shri Naik said that the Plant will come up with technical assistance for the process being provided by IOC (R & D). The proposal envisages that the funding of the project would be done by the Oil Industry Development Board (OIDB). The Ministry has referred the project proposal to Scientific Advisory Committee on Hydrocarbon of the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas for their consideration and recommendation. The proposal comes in the wake of a break-through claimed by Professor Alka Zadgaonkar, Head of the Department of Applied Chemistry of an Engineering College at Nagpur regarding recovery of oil from plastic waste. Several experiments were conducted by a joint team of IOC (R&D) and Prof. Zadgaonkar between 1st July and 10th July 2003 at the R&D Centre of IOC, Faridabad. The findings of the report prepared by IOC (R&D) on the process indicate that before the fuel obtained is used for auto and other purposes, its chlorine content, diene level etc., are required to be controlled. On the bio-diesel front, Shri Naik informed that a 3 pronged strategy is being followed by the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas which involve commencing a pilot project at Rewari, Haryana to see the impact of 5% bio-diesel blended diesel on vehicles in Indian conditions and monitoring the Memorandum of Understanding signed by IOC with the Indian Railways for production of bio-diesel. Thirdly, the Ministry is cooperating with the Ministry of Rural Development in implementation of the Report prepared by the Planning Commission on ""Development of Bio-Fuels"". Keeping in view, the high cost of implementation of the project due to high price and lower availability of bio-diesel, Shri Naik said the Ministry is seeking exemption on import of bio-diesel for pilot project purpose from customs duty. He further informed that a limited tender for procurement of bio-diesel for the purpose of pilot project at Rewari has obtained response from two parties only at a price of about Rs. 70 per litre at Faridabad. Bio diesel from non-edible oils seeds is not available within the country. Project funding is proposed from the OIDB’s budget. To stop poor quality of oils from being passed off as bio-diesel, Shri Naik emphasised that standard specifications for the product are required to be formulated before a large scale bio-diesel programme takes off in the country. Shri Ram Naik also informed that the Government has directed Oil Companies to sell only Ethanol-Blended Petrol (EBP) in the State of Tamil Nadu and Union Territory (UT) of Pondicherry w.e.f. 1.1.2004 as the State Government of Tamil Nadu has now reduced the sales tax from 12% to 8% and scrapped purchase tax on inter-oil company transactions in petrol. The programme was kept in abeyance in these areas vide notification dated 29.9.2003 due to complex and high tax structure which made the sale of EBP unviable in Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry. So far 7 states namely, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Punjab & Uttar Pradesh and 3 UTs of Chandigarh, Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu have been fully covered and Andhra Pradesh which is now partially covered would have the supply of only EBP by 31.12.2003. The States of Uttaranchal from 1.1.2004 and Madhya Pradesh from 1.3.2004 would also be covered with the sale of ethanol blended petrol. Replying to queries of the Members, Smt. Sumitra Mahajan, Minister of State for Petroleum & Natural Gas, emphasised that the programme to produce bio-diesel has larger interest of the nation in mind as they offer avenues for reducing India’s import dependence for oil together with efforts to produce more oil and gas in the country and to acquire equity oil abroad. She reiterated that the ethanol blending with petrol would be expanded to other States in phases. Besides reducing import dependence it would help farmers with better returns and reduce emission of vehicular pollutants to bring environmental benefits. Regarding high procurement cost of bio-diesel, Smt. Mahajan pointed out that the programme is at very initial and experimental stage, therefore the cost of procurement as of now should not be the judging factor for viability of the programme. In the ultimate analysis, it is very important to take up such a project from the standpoint of immense potential for benefitting the country. Regarding loss of gas through flaring Smt. Mahajan informed that under a programme to reduce gas flaring it has come down from about 8 per cent to 4 per cent or less which is a significant achievement. Government is also examining if the flaring can be reduced further in oil gas producing areas including North-Eastern States. The Members lauded the efforts of the Government for launching ethanol-petrol blending programme initiative , efforts to harness bio-diesel and the initiative to convert plastic waste into petrol. They have, however, suggested that the Government should see that the benefit of the programme reach the farmers, and result in price reduction whenever possible. The Members felt that these initiatives have great potential for enhancing self sufficiency in oil sector. Additional Secretary .(MOP&NG), Shri M.S. Srinivasan, CMDs of Oil PSUs and other senior officers of the Ministry and oil PSUs also attended the meeting.

During the current year till September, 2003 the sugar mills had stocks of about 103 lakh tonnes and since the prices are going down again the period for buffer stock has been extended for one more year till 17 December, 2004. So that, the farmer may get the same amount as arrears from sugar mills as in previous year. There is a Monitoring Committee in the Ministry, which looks after the interest of the farmers. The Committee has taken precautions so that sugar mills can open separate accounts in the banks to get this money or Cane Commissioner has to certify that the mill owner has given the money directly to the farmers."""

He was speaking after launching the scheme here today. The Prime Minister said that there are about one crore twenty five lakh weavers and artisans in the country, most whom are landless. They need credit at reasonable rates to compete effectively both at home and abroad . He said, being landless, they are forced to borrow at higher interest. The Prime Minister said, the scheme has been prepared keeping this in view. The Prime Minister distributed cards to eight beneficiaries to mark the launching of the scheme. The scheme was simultaneously launched in Etawah by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minsiter Shri Mulayam Singh Yadav, in Bhubaneswar by Orissa Chief Minster Shri Naveen Patnaik and in Hyderabad by Andhra Pradesh Ckhief Minister Shri Chandrababu Naidu with the three centres connected to Delhi through videoconference. Speaking on the occasion the Minister for Textiles Shri Syed Shahnawaz Hussain said that the Prime Minster had announced the scheme in his address to the nation on the Independence Day. He said, we have now fulfilled the promise. The country earns foreign exchange worth 12 billion Dollars by exporting handicrafts, handlooms, garments and textiles. He said, the scheme has been prepared in association with the Indian Bank Association. Shri Hussain said, we need to create conditions to make our weavers and artisans competitive as the quota system ends in 2004. He hoped that the credit card will be an important step in that direction. Under the scheme the maximum credit limit is Rs. 2 lakh and it carries an interest of nine percent. However, women borrowers will get half a percent rebate in interest."
353,19-December-2003 19:45 IST,Ministry of Commerce & Industry,India reiterates support for multilateral process TEXT OF STATEMENT BY ARUN JAITLEY REGARDING CANCUN MINISTERIAL CONFERENCE,"India has been engaging constructively in the multilateral trade negotiations and is optimistic that despite the lack of progress at the Cancun Ministerial Conference, it would be possible to move forward in the weeks to come. India is also committed to ensuring that ""development"" lies at the core of the Doha agenda. In a statement regarding the Fifth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) held at Cancun, Mexico during 10-14 September, 2003, in the Lok Sabha today, Shri Arun Jaitley, Union Minister of Commerce & Industry, emphasised that for India, the multilateral process is extremely important and said: ""we are willing to work together and engaged in a process of give and take so that mutually acceptable outcomes may be reached. Movement forward demands understanding and accommodation"". The following is the full text of Shri Jaitley’s statement: ""1. I rise to make a statement on the proceedings of the Fifth Ministerial Conference of the WTO held at Cancún, Mexico during 10-14 September 2003. A copy of the Ministerial Statement is being placed on the Table of the House. 2. The Cancún Ministerial Conference was due to take stock of the progress in negotiations under the Work Programme launched by the Doha Declaration and to provide guidance to negotiators on key areas such as agriculture, tariff negotiations for non-agricultural products, special and differential treatment and implementation issues. The Conference also had to decide on whether or not to launch negotiations on Singapore Issues based on modalities agreed to by ‘explicit consensus’. 3. In preparation for the Conference, the Government held wide-ranging consultations with all major stakeholders and had accordingly formulated its negotiating strategy. This strategy was based on an appreciation of our trade interests, development concerns and gains to be made by improving the multilateral trading system. We went to Cancún in a positive frame of mind with a desire to engage proactively in the negotiations for a fruitful outcome. 4. The Conference which concluded in Cancún on 14 September 2003 could not reach a decision covering all areas. An important reason for the lack of a decision at Cancún was the inability of the proposals on the table to forge a consensus by taking into account the concerns of all Members on many contentious issues. The conference ended with a Ministerial Statement which recognised that more work needed to be done in key areas to enable WTO Member countries to proceed towards the conclusion of negotiations under the Doha mandate. 5. The developments at Cancun have been a disappointment for us. We are interested in having a healthy, effective multilateral trading system, which would provide the institutional backdrop for a process of economic development that would benefit all countries. The overriding priority and consideration for a developing country like India in any trading arrangement is the implication of such an arrangement for its economic development. This focus on development determines our position on any trade rules and proposals at the WTO. Our goal at Cancun on major issues was guided by national interest. 6. In agriculture, our desire was to ensure that agriculture markets across the world are freed from the substantial distortions that are caused by large scale subsidisation. These distortions prevent agriculture from fulfilling its potential of being an engine of growth. Income inequalities caused so far by such distortions continue. It is essential in the interests of equity, justice and fair play that the distortions in agriculture are gradually eliminated. Therefore, agricultural market access in developing countries has to be sequenced appropriately with reductions in market distortions elsewhere. At the same time, we wish to protect the interests of the millions of subsistence level framers who depend on agriculture as their sole means of sustenance. Therefore, there has to be a calibrated approach to market access vis-à-vis reduction in distortions in agriculture with a transition period in which affected farmers are shielded through the use of special safeguard mechanisms and protection for special products. In view of all this, expecting us to make onerous market access commitments inconsistent with the reality in agriculture was unreasonable. The draft modalities on agriculture proposed at Cancun, on the other hand, did not take into account these concerns fully and would in all probability, have perpetuated distortions. We had no choice but to oppose these modalities. 7. On tariff negotiations in non-agricultural products, significant convergence in negotiating positions could be realised by taking on board the concerns of all Members. 8. On Singapore Issues, one has to address the question of multilateral rule making taking primacy over economic development goals, particularly in areas where the interplay between these new issues and development is unknown. The Ministerial Conference had to take a decision on modalities for all the Singapore Issues. However, this was to be by explicit consensus. Discussions clearly revealed that not only was this consensus absent but that most developing countries felt that the clarification process on these issues had not run its full course. In the absence of clarity on many elements, a majority of the membership of the WTO had rejected launch of negotiations on these issues and sought a continuation of the clarification process. There were concerns that a framework on Investment would constrain the policy space for developing countries in utilising FDI for their development goals. There was no certainty that such a framework would lead to larger FDI flows nor was any need for a framework demonstrated. On Competition Policy, the issue of encroaching upon the freedom of competition authorities was disquieting. The benefits of a framework on Transparency in Government Procurement was also not clear. In spite of this, proposals tabled suggested launch of negotiations in some areas. In the absence of explicit consensus, launching negotiations was, however, an impossibility. 9. India was also disappointed that no time frame was prescribed for resolving outstanding implementation issues. These issues highlight the imbalances arising out of the Uruguay Round agreement and need to be addressed on a priority basis so that imbalances brought in by the Uruguay round are redressed. On Special & Differential Treatment Issues, India felt that adequate urgency was not being shown in addressing these issues. 10. An important outcome from our viewpoint is the engagement of developing countries in the negotiating process. Unlike in the past, when they were blamed for non-participation, the degree of participation of the large group of developing countries is a welcome development. Not only have developing countries become participants in the process but have also shown adequate flexibility to reach out to other fellow countries to form alliances which have been formed during and after the conference. The G-20 on Agriculture and the G-16 on Singapore Issues embody the desire of developing countries to generate common positions on issues. 11. The Ministerial Conference concluded with a Ministerial Statement which recognised that more work needed to be done in some key areas to enable WTO Member countries to proceed towards the conclusion of negotiations under the Doha mandate. The Ministerial Statement has instructed officials to continue working on outstanding issues with a renewed sense of urgency and purpose and taking fully into account all the views expressed in the Ministerial Conference. The Chairman of the General Council of the WTO, working in close coordination with the Director General, were also asked to coordinate this work and to convene a meeting of the General Council at senior officials level no later than 15th December 2003 to enable successful and timely conclusion of the negotiations. 12. As Hon’ble Members would appreciate, trade negotiations are a protracted process. We have been engaging constructively in the negotiations and are optimistic that despite the lack of progress at the Cancun Ministerial Conference, it would be possible to move forward in the weeks to come. Agriculture has been at the core of the negotiations. Our sensitivities on Singapore Issues also need to be understood. We are also committed to ensuring that ‘development’ lies at the core of the Doha agenda, as mandated at the Doha Ministerial Conference of WTO. 13. For India, the multilateral process is an extremely important one. We believe that a rule based trading system provides a fair, transparent, predictable, secure and durable environment for trade relations between nations. We have been demanding that the system be fair – fair to our development goals, to our economic needs, to our economic and social reality and to our aspirations. The multilateral system continues to enjoy our support and we are participating in the process of further negotiations in Geneva. We are willing to work together and engage in a process of give and take so that mutually acceptable outcomes may be reached. Movement forward demands understanding and accommodation. Our only desire is that the discussions be carried out in a more understanding and sensitive manner so that trade liberalization does actually deliver the fruit of development""."

The solar eclipse of November 23-24, 2003, was a rare event occurring once in 400 years and hence assumed great scientific importance. The short duration eclipse was observed over India’s permanent station at Antarctica ""Maitri"". The important experiments conducted by the Indian team included Multi Wavelength coronal imaging, shadow bands observations and Thermal response of the terrestrial atmosphere. The eclipse produced a splendid and spectacular display of some Bailey’s beads, crimson and beautiful diamond rings and a corona in its full golden glory with extended streamers. In addition it resulted in the generation of extensive shadow-bands which are the rarest and of longest duration running into minutes. The experiments done by Indian team were highly successful in recording valuable digital data on various aspects of the spectacle. The most significant was the long duration shadow bands. The data collected are being analysed and the findings would be highly interesting and valuable, as Antarctica plays a vital role in the determination of global climatic and atmospheric conditions. The team was fully supported by our 22nd Wintering Antarctic expedition group. The success of the national mission has brought more glory to the Indian Antarctic programme."

362,03-December-2003 16:7 IST,Ministry of Agriculture,"Advanced economies should not be allowed to undermine livelihood security of farmers in developing countries, says Rajnath Singh","India has called upon the international community not to allow advanced economies to undermine the livelihood security of farmers in the developing countries under the guise of self-serving trade reforms. Addressing a round table meeting on WTO-related agricultural issues in Rome yesterday evening, the Agriculture Minister, Shri Rajnath Singh said that the livelihood security of the large agriculture-dependent population is an issue of paramount importance in waging a war against hunger in the developing countries. Expressing concern over bulging subsidies and unjustified protection to agriculture in the developed countries, the Minister said that these have rendered the developing countries highly vulnerable in the agricultural trade regime. Deprivations caused to farmers by distorted trade are evident across much of the developing world. Shri Rajnath Singh argued that the provisions contained in the Agreement on Agriculture left a yawning gap between expectations and achievements. The imbalances in the Agreement could be removed only by striking a balance among the three pillars of market access, domestic support and export competition. But the developed countries were seeking tariff reduction in the developing countries without demonstrating sincerity to usher in meaningful reforms in the two pillars of domestic support and export subsidies. This amounted to paying mere lip service to the reform process. Shri Rajnath Singh stressed the need to give a special and differential treatment to the developing countries for addressing their legitimate development needs including food and livelihood security and rural development. Regretting that the Cancun Draft of 13th September 2003 was not in consonance with the Doha mandate on agricultural trade reforms he said that the initiative to put the negotiation process back on the rails should come from the developed countries. The negotiations need to recognize the fact that a level playing field cannot be created without meaningfully addressing the concerns of the developing countries and giving them much more flexibility and leverage. The Minister expressed the hope that the spirit of development enshrined in the Doha Declaration would be given due regard when the negotiation process resumes. Representatives from over 60 countries took part in the round table meeting organized by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). Shri Rajnath Singh also held discussions with the Agriculture Ministers of New Zealand, Sweden, Finland and Japan and with the Agriculture Commissioner of the European Union."

The Commonwealth is a group of countries which share political values of democracy, human freedoms and rule of low. Most Commonwealth members are also developing countries with common concerns about development and the promotion of rule-based international trading and investment regimes. As democracies, we face similar transnational threats from terrorism, drug trafficking, arms smuggling and money laundering, all which are closely interrelated. Commonwealth leaders will exchange views on these issues at the Summit. The special theme of the Abuja Summit – Democracy and Development – provides an opportunity for the Commonwealth to ponder on the important developmental questions which today engage developing democracies as they grapple with the challenges of globalization. A Summit of this nature also provides occasion for formal and informal bilateral discussions with a number of other world leaders. Though I will not be in Abuja for the entire duration of the Summit, I expect to have the opportunity to interact with a fairly wide cross-section of Commonwealth leaders. I am happy that Nigeria is hosting the Commonwealth Summit and look forward to meeting President Obasanjo in Abuja. Nigeria is one of India’s most important friends in Africa, besides being our largest trading partner in the continent. We have had a long-standing association in the Non Aligned Movement and in the struggle against colonialism and apartheid in the second half of the twentieth century.”"

392,20-December-2003 18:47 IST,Ministry of Finance,India’s foreign exchange reserves cross US $ 100 billion STATEMENT BY THE FINANCE MINISTER,"India’s foreign exchange reserves have crossed US $ 100 billion mark. Following is the text of statement of the Union Finance Minister, Shri Jaswant Singh made here today after India’s foreign exchange reserves crossed the US $ 100 billion mark. “Governor, Reserve Bank of India informed me today Saturday, December 20, that India’s foreign exchange reserve comprising foreign currency assets, gold and Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) had reached USD 100.48 billion, on December 19, 2003. I am glad to share that this is an historic high, such a level of reserves never having been reached earlier by the country ever. It may be recalled that the level of our foreign exchange reserved had fallen to a low of less than USD 1 billion in December 1990. It is also noteworthy that since end March, 1991, whereas India’s foreign exchange reserves have risen by around USD 94 billion, at the same time our external debt has gone up by only about US $ 20 billion. This level of reserves has been built by removing many of the restrictions on economic activity, managing the policy framework prudently and enabling the entrepreneurial spirit of Indians, resident and non-resident, to blossom and to prosper. More important, our reserves will add greater momentum to bolder economic reforms, enabling the country to achieve significantly higher growth. Infact, this will also provide a cushion thus facilitating higher levels of investment activity in the country and abroad. The nation’s forex reserves contribute very significantly to our national security; apart from providing a much greater degree of national autonomy to the conduct of public policy, consistent of course, with international obligations. Our reserves will, in addition, enable Indian corporates and financial intermediaries to access needed foreign currency resources for their domestic and global activities, at finer and more favourable terms than ever before. In this context, it is necessary to recollect that our foreign exchange reserves have touched a record level of USD 100 billion despite and after: <U+F0B7> Prepayment of USD 5.0 billion of external debt of Government of India in the calendar year 2003; <U+F0B7> Payment of USD 5.5 billion, on account of redemption of Resurgent India Bonds (RIBs) during the year; <U+F0B7> Making a contribution of USD 498 million this year towards the Financial Transactions Plan (FTP) of International Monetary Fund to enable it to lend to countries that require assistance; <U+F0B7> and, taking several measures during the recent months to eliminate undesirable speculative or arbitrage practices. The Reserve Bank of India has assured me that these forex reserves will, as in the past, continue to be used to contain volatility in the forex market, provide comfort to launch policy measures for accelerated growth and to withstand any possible supply shocks. On this occasion, I wish to compliment the Reserve bank of India, its present and past Governor, who so ably pursued a policy of prudent management of exchange rate, interest rate, liquidity conditions and forex reserves. These policies, I am assured by the RBI, will continue to be followed keeping in view the overriding macro objectives of growth, price stability and financial stability."
393,21-December-2003 15:52 IST,Ministry of Railways,All time record performance of Railways during 2003-2004,"Year end Review Indian Railways recorded an all time high performance both in the transportation of freight and passengers during the current financial year ending November 2003. A total of 358.27 Million Tonnes (MTs) of revenue earning freight was transported as compared to 334.46 MTs during the corresponding period of the previous year, recording an increase of 23.82 MTs. This also exceeded the target of 340.3 MTs by 8.88 MTs for the period. In passenger traffic, the increase recorded is over three per cent. The total earnings of Indian Railways upto October 2003 are Rs. 24029.05 crores as compared to Rs. 23165.65 crore during the corresponding period of the previous year, recording an increase of 3.73 per cent. The punctuality performance of passenger carrying trains was between 95 per cent to 98 per cent. The current year witnessed unprecedented scale of safety related measures on the Railways. For the first time, a White Paper on Railway Safety was issued in April 2003, setting in motion public debate for improving safety of train services. This was followed by national level safety workshops in July 2003 with similar workshops (Safety Sambad) at Zonal Railways level. All concerns about safety including the minutest details were addressed by the Government. The result was introduction of a Corporate Safety Plan (2003-2013) for a period of ten years, making all railway functionaries from the top to the lowest accountable for safety of rail services. In addition, safety was introduced as a buzz word for all railway employees and it has to be kept uppermost in their minds as a mantra. As a result of various safety measures taken, the total number of train accidents remained constant as in the last year. At the same time, there has been a significant improvement in the areas of safety performance. For example, there were three train collisions as against ten train collisions during the corresponding period of the previous year. Similarly, the accidents at manned level crossing gates dropped from nine to six and the train derailments from 151 to 148. A Technology Mission on Rail Safety in collaboration with Department of Science and Technology and IIT, Kanpur was also set up during the year. In addition, all the new Zones became functional with effect from April 1, 2003 making a total of 16 Zones. This helped the Railways achieve an all-round improvement in the performance with a focused attention on development and augmentation of rail services. As announced in the Railway Budget 2003-2004, most of the 50 pairs of new trains have already been introduced and the remaining such trains would be introduced before the end of the current financial year. The year also witnessed massive cleanliness drive on Railways. A decision was taken to introduce mechanized clean train at 50 major stations beginning with Ratlam.

395,04-December-2003 12:12 IST,Ministry of Coal,Coal shortage to be met by imports and domestic production,"The Planning Commission has projected that against the estimated demand for coal by the end of the Tenth Plan (2006-07) of 460.50 million tonnes (M.T.) the domestic supply of coal will be of the order of 405 M.T. which is likely to result in a demand supply gap of the order of 55 M.T. The Minister for Coal Shri Kariya Munda informed the Rajya Sabha that in respect of the projections for the end of the Eleventh Five Year Plan (2011-12), the Working Group on Coal and Lignite in its report for the Tenth Plan has estimated a demand of 620 M.T, and domestic production of 525 M.T. which is likely to result in a demand supply gap of the order of 95 M.T. The estimated demand supply gap of 55 M.T. in the terminal year of the Tenth Plan (2006-07) is likely to be met through import of coal (estimated at 34 M.T.) and also increasing the domestic coal production and also having an efficient demand management system in place. In order to achieve the production targets set for the terminal year of the Tenth Plan (2006-07) the Coal Companies have an action plan approved by the Planning Commission for incurring capital expenditure of the order of Rs. 16,423 Crore (including Rs. 14,310 Crore by Coal India Ltd. and Rs. 2113 Crore by Singareni Collieries Company Ltd.). the Coal Production target in 2006-07 has been st at 405 M.T. which comprises 350 M.T. from CIL and 36.13 M.T. from SCCL, and the remaining 18.87 from private players including captive block holders. Of the envisaged total production of 386.13 M.T. from CIL and SCCL, CIL has identified 92 new projects which will be taken up during the Tenth Plan which will contribute about 79.11 M.T. SCCL will implement 17 new projects for a capacity of 4.13 M.T. In addition to this a number of steps are being taken to increase productivity from existing mines which include Inter-alia: Increase in mechanisation through introduction of continuous miners, longwall powered supports in underground mines, planning open cast mines with higher capacity excavators; Scheduled equipment maintenance programmes, utilization of skilled manpower and also training personnel to handle capital intensive equipment, offloading certain activities such as overburden removal, mechanization of Underground Mine operations and also opting the higher capacity HEMM.In reply to another question the Minister of State for Coal Shri Prahlad Singh Patel informed the Rajya Sabha that in order to augment coal production in the country and to bridge the gap between demand and supply of coal, the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act, 1973 was amended in 1993 for private participation in coal mining to the industries engaged in generation of power, washing of coal obtained from a mine or such other end use as the Central Government may, by notification, specify. Industries engaged in production of Iron and Steel were already eligible under the Act for captive coal mining. Production of Cement was added in this category in 1996. Considering the coal blocks allocated so far under the provision, 49 coal blocks stand allocated to various companies in the public and private sectors as on date. The private sector is already allowed captive mining of coal for production of iron and steel. In addition to this, with effect from 9.6.1993, the Government has also allowed the private sector to captively mine coal for generation of power, washing of coal obtained from a mine or for other end uses as may be notified by the Government from time to time. Mining of Coal for production of cement has also been permitted by the Government vide notification dated 15.3.1996. Furthermore, the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Amendment Bill, 2000 has been introduced in the Rajya Sabha on 24.4.2000, which seeks to allow the private sector Indian companies to commercially mine coal and lignite without the existing restriction of captive consumption and also engage in exploration of coal and lignite resources in the country.

Drawing attention of the entrepreneurs and technologists towards high energy and water consumption by the pulp and paper industry in India, Dr. Joshi asked them to innovate ways to conserve such scarce resources. They could utilise alternative resources like agricultural residues and recyclable waste, and search for other ways of reducing dependence on the traditional resources, he suggested. Elaborating further the need for environmental conservation, Dr. Joshi said that we should look at containing consumption of natural resources to a sustainable level so that they are available to the poor and keep serving future generations. Pulp and paper industries have an added social responsibility to limit their dependence on non-renewable and scarce natural resources, Dr. Joshi said, as they tend to over-consume these resources."

This was informed by Shri Kashiram Rana, Union Minister for Rural Development in the meeting of the General Council of NIRD at Hyderabad today. The most appropriate and affordable technologies across the country will be showcased in the Rural Technology Park, which will help in quick dissemination of rural technologies, Shri Rana said. Shri Rana highlighted that in the areas of research, the Institute has come out with new Action Research Studies particularly multi-disciplinary studies, which will go a long-way in not only improving the quality of the programmes of the Ministry, but also in identifying the problems that hamper speedy development of the rural areas and the rural people. The models developed through Action Research are seen to provide answers to some of the major problems being faced by the Panchayati Raj Institutions with regard to resource scarcity, social mobilisation, women empowerment and above all focused community action. Listing out new initiatives taken by National Institute of Rural Development (NIRD), Shri Rana informed that the Institute has involved leading institutions in the country with a view to improving the quality of training and research. In this regard NIRD has involved Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, Mumbai, Institute of Economic Growth, IRMA, ISAC, Bangalore etc. Shri Rana told that NIRD has been increasing its training and research activities. As against 160 programmes conducted during the previous years, the NIRD could organize 177 training programmes during the last year. The task of training of about 30 lakh of elected members of Panchayati Raj Institutions is indeed a stupendous one. NIRD has been able to establish active links with the State Institutes of Rural Development, Extension Training Centres (ETC) and Panchayati Raj Training Centres [PRTCs], facilitating larger out-reach of NIRD’S training activities. The networking and partnership built up by NIRD has yielded good results as is evident from the fact that the number of persons trained through the network of NIRD, SIRDS, and ETCs has increased from a mere fifty thousand till a few years ago, to nearly one lakh during the last two years. Shri Rana pointed out that State Institute of Rural Development, Mysore provides training through satellite. NIRD being National Training Institute, should also have such facility. Shri Rana highlighted that the strength and reputation of any Institute is judged by the recognition it receives from the outside world. In this respect, NIRD has been able to emerge as a Centre of Excellence. Apart from rendering assistance to the Ministry of Rural Development, NIRD is also being approached by various Ministries such as the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Textiles and a large number of International organizations, such as DFID, ILO, UNDP, National Commission on Population, Twelfth Finance Commission."

Shri Advani said New Delhi has been successfully in creating a worldwide awareness on the menace of terrorism and the international community today is prepared to counter any threat. But the world woke up to horrors of terrorism only after the September 11 attack on the World Trade Centre. Hailing the CISF for countering the security threats effectively, Shri Advani said the Force has expanded its activities mani-fold which include maintaining the security at airports and private establishments. Times have radically changed and so our security needs and therefore, it is the concern of every Indian how to tackle the terrorist menace.

399,05-December-2003 12:21 IST,Ministry of Human Resource Development,Notification banning advertisements on infant food to be effective from 1st January 2004,"The Government has notified that the amendments to the Infant Milk Substitutes, Feeding Bottles and Infant Foods (Regulation of production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 1992 would come into force from 1st January 2004. An earlier notification had made the amendments effective from 1st November this year. Advertising for infant milk substitutes and other infant foods will be prohibited on all forms of mass media from January 1st next year. The ban on advertising of infant foods is meant to protect and promote breast-feeding.

The World Health Assembly resolution of 1994 also calls upon member states of the WHO to foster such feeding practices for infants. The amendments also expand the purview of the Act to include diverse products being marketed as a complement to mother’s food and to include different types of people associated with marketing/representing such products. The amendments to the Infant Milk Substitutes Act are the outcome of a long process that started with the Government constituting a Task Force for this purpose, comprising representatives from various ministries and departments of the Central Government and voluntary agencies. The National Commission for Women had also suggested modifications in the Act. Taking into consideration the recommendations of these two bodies, and difficulties being experiences in the implementation of the provisions of the Act owing to great expansion of the electronic media over the years, the Government brought out the present amendments. The important amendments in the principal Act are: Strengthening the existing provisions on publicity and advertisement to cover recent methods of advertising and promotion like electronic transmission and audio-visual transmission. Continued breast-feeding ""up to the age of two years"" along with complementary food after ""six months"" (in place of the earlier ""four months"") has been incorporated in the definition of ""infant food"". Continued breast-feeding ""up to the age of two years"" has been incorporated in the definition of ""infant food"". To cover recent products which may attempt to get around the principal Act, ""infant foods"" have been brought at par with ""infant milk substitutes"" in so far as advertising, promotion and other regulations are concerned. Health care workers, pharmacies and drug stores and professional associations of health workers have been brought within the purview of the Act. Violations of the Rules made under the Act have also been made punishable."

Prices have decreased from the levels attained during August, 2003. Comparison of domestic prices with the Freight on Board (FOB) prices of exports is not justifiable. The FOB prices are always lower than the domestic market prices because these prices do not include customs/excise duties, transportation costs and other sundry levies. The importer of Indian steel pay a higher price than the FOB price - the difference being equal to the customs duty, the transportation charges to the user and any other indirect taxes levied on steel in that country. The Government does not provide any specific export incentives to the steel sector other than those which are generally available to exporters under duty remission/exemption schemes etc. of the Exim Policy.

Speaking at the 17th Annual Day Function of the Indian Railway Finance Corporation (IRFC) here yesterday evening, Shri Nitish Kumar expressed his concern over the shortages of wagons stating that out of procurement of 22,000 wagons targeted for the current financial year 2003-2004, only 7,000 wagons were procured so far from the outside sources. Talking of various measures like phasing out of four wheeler wagons, strengthening of Golden Quadrilateral and its diagonals, port connectivity, reducing speed gap and buoyancy in the economy, the Minister exuded confidence that the wagon industry would expedite supply of wagons as the demands for wagons were to go up further. The Minister complimented the IRFC for its excellent performance and asked it and other railway public sector undertakings to invest in the equity of RailTel Corporation of India. The Minister said that having been encouraged by the success of IRFC, its funding was now even more attractive than the funding from budgetary support. As the Railways had huge investment programmes for implementation of the National Rail Vikas Yojana (NRVY), the special purpose vehicle, the Rail Vikas Nigame Ltd. set up to oversee and execute NRVY, was in need for accessing debt markets in the coming years. In this connection, the Government has asked the IRFC to prepare a concept paper looking to its considerable expertise in the area. The Chairman Railway Board, Shri R.K. Singh, who also spoke on the occasion, complimented IRFC for having reduced the cost of borrowing to 6.2 per cent in 2002-2003, hoping it would play an important role in the implementation of the Corporate Safety Plan (2003-2013). The Chairperson, IRFC and Financial Commissioner (Railways) Smt. Vijayalaxmi Viswanathan said that the Company has graduated from a high cost borrowings to the low cost mobilization following growing liquidity in the capital market. The result has been a cumulative investment of Rs. 26,000 crores for augmenting rolling stock. Earlier, the Managing Director, IRFC, Shri Balachandram, in his welcome address gave an overview of the performance of the company during the last 17 years of its existence. During the current fiscal year ending November 2003, IRFC has mobilized 75 per cent of Rs. 2,970 crores, the target fixed for it in the Railway Budget 2003-2004, at an average cost of 6.1 per cent taking advantage of the liquidity in the market and its credit rating, which is the highest. Given the market reports of low appetite for commercial credit, the Company is hopeful of achieving the borrowing target at a cost lower than the previous year."

The Rashtriya Ispal Nigam Limited (RINL) the other PSU of the Ministry is also interested to acquire captive iron ore mines to meet its increasing requirements, today said the Minister of Steel, Shri Braja Kishore Tripathy addressing the Members of the Consultative Committee attached to his Ministry. He informed that efforts are being made to obtain mining licences and other clearances from the concerned State Governments to develop large mechanized mines. The Minister said that the quality of iron ore available in India is of world standard and it is the real strength of the Indian steel industry. With a view to ensure that high grade iron ore is available to the Indian industry for a long time, exports of high grade iron ore are made through a designated canalizing agency only and it is subject to the ceiling imposed by the Government. He informed that the steel consumption in the country is expected to increase from 30 million tonnes to 55 million tonnes by the year 2011-12 and the public sector unit would require more iron ore to step up their production to meet the growing need. Shri Tripathy gave a brief account of the growing steel sector and said the finished steel production has grown by 9.9 per cent during 2002-03 and reached 33.67 million tonnes. From April to November 2003-04, its total production was 22.800 million tonnes which is 6.2 per cent higher than the production of the corresponding period last year.

452,23-December-2003 14:24 IST,Ministry of Agriculture,New Scheme on Sustainable Development of Horticulture Initiated,"The Centre has initiated a new scheme on Sustainable Development of Horticulture through Technological Interventions. The scheme would address new issues like development of horticulture in island eco-systems and promote Indian horticulture in the international arena. The Agriculture Secretary Shri R.C.A.Jain said this while inaugurating the annual National Horticulture Conference here this morning. A new scheme on High-Tech Horticulture and Precision Farming has also been included in the 10th Plan to promote all aspects of high-tech horticulture covering technology dissemination and application on the farmer’s field. The Agriculture Secretary said that the horticulture sector is still in a transition state and development of technologies starting from production of planting material to value addition of produce needs to acquire accelerated pace. He said that the task of doubling the horticulture production by the end of 2011-12 is a big challenge which will require efforts to implement a National Mission on Horticulture. In the quest for diversification of agriculture, horticulture has emerged as the most viable option. Turning to WTO related issues , Shri R.C.A.Jain called upon the State Governments to urgently identify the crops which are critical from the point of view of food and livelihood security so that suitable measures could be taken in terms of appropriate bound rates of tariff and other non-tariff measures. He assured that all efforts are being made to protect the interests of the country’s farmers during the on –going negotiations . Farmers also need to be sensitized to maintain high quality standards at competitive cost to avail of the market access opportunities abroad. Application of stringent sanitary and phyto-sanitary measures by the developed countries on exports from India is an issue in the context of export efforts. Judicious use of pesticides and chemicals assumes greater significance in the context of food safety issues. Health hazards due to pesticide residues become more acute with the use of pesticides in horticultural crops which are largely consumed fresh. Shri R.C.A. Jain called upon the Plant Protection Orgnisation to gear itself up for surveillance, certification and inspection for export of horticultural crops to the countries with stringent requirements. The Agriculture Secretary lamented that despite efforts being made by the National Horticulture Board to collate and document the information on area, production, productivity, arrival and prices of horticultural produce, the data base on horticulture is very weak. Despite requests to the State Governments to furnish information about the situation of sensitive horticultural crops on weekly basis, the same has not been forthcoming to the desired extent. Pointing out that availability of timely data is crucial for facilitating decisions having a direct bearing on the farming community, the Agriculture Secretary called upon the State Governments to cooperate in furnishing the required information. He informed the Conference that the work for launching an exclusive TV and radio channel on Agriculture for dissemination of knowledge and Kisan Call Centres for easy access to information is in an advanced stage. These initiatives will have far reaching impact on Indian farmers and make agriculture a knowledge-based enterprise. In his address, the Horticulture Commissioner, Dr. H.P.Singh listed the challenges in the way of achieving the targeted horticultural production of 300 million tonnes by the end of the 11th Plan.. He said that productivity of many horticultural crops continue to be low and post harvest losses continue to be high. Quality of produce needs improvement and resource use efficiency requires upgradation. Although India is ranked second in the world in the production of fruits as well as vegetables, availability of fruits and vegetables still continues to be much below the dietary requirements. Dr. Singh also informed the Conference that bamboo is being declared as a horticultural and plantation crop. The Agriculture Ministry is the nodal Ministry for implementation of the Bamboo Mission. The two-day Conference will review the progress of various horticultural programmes and will also discuss emerging issues to develop a road map for the envisaged horticulture- led transformation. Horticulture Secretaries and Directors from various States, Vice Chancellors of various State Agriculture Universities, horticulture experts, senior officers from various Ministries and representatives of various commodity associations are taking part in the Conference."

The TAUVEX is a set of three wide-field telescopes that will image the ultraviolet sky. It was specifically recognised that installing TAUVEX on-board the technology demonstrator satellite GSAT-4 would be ideal for operating TAUVEX as a scientific payload in geo-synchronous orbit. While this will allow the Israeli team to realise its goals, it will bring in UV expertise to the Indian astrophysical community."

467,23-December-2003 17:54 IST,Ministry of Agriculture,New Scheme on sustainable development of horticulture initiated,"The Centre has initiated a new scheme on Sustainable Development of Horticulture through Technological Interventions. The scheme would address new issues like development of horticulture in island eco-systems and promote Indian horticulture in the international arena. The Agriculture Secretary Shri R.C.A.Jain said this while inaugurating the annual National Horticulture Conference here this morning. A new scheme on High-Tech Horticulture and Precision Farming has also been included in the 10th Plan to promote all aspects of high-tech horticulture covering technology dissemination and application on the farmer’s field. The Agriculture Secretary said that the horticulture sector is still in a transition state and development of technologies starting from production of planting material to value addition of produce needs to acquire accelerated pace. He said that the task of doubling the horticulture production by the end of 2011-12 is a big challenge which will require efforts to implement a National Mission on Horticulture. In the quest for diversification of agriculture, horticulture has emerged as the most viable option. Turning to WTO related issues , Shri R.C.A.Jain called upon the State Governments to urgently identify the crops which are critical from the point of view of food and livelihood security so that suitable measures could be taken in terms of appropriate bound rates of tariff and other non-tariff measures. He assured that all efforts are being made to protect the interests of the country’s farmers during the on –going negotiations . Farmers also need to be sensitized to maintain high quality standards at competitive cost to avail of the market access opportunities abroad. Application of stringent sanitary and phyto-sanitary measures by the developed countries on exports from India is an issue in the context of export efforts. Judicious use of pesticides and chemicals assumes greater significance in the context of food safety issues. Health hazards due to pesticide residues become more acute with the use of pesticides in horticultural crops which are largely consumed fresh. Shri R.C.A. Jain called upon the Plant Protection Orgnisation to gear itself up for surveillance, certification and inspection for export of horticultural crops to the countries with stringent requirements. The Agriculture Secretary lamented that despite efforts being made by the National Horticulture Board to collate and document the information on area, production, productivity, arrival and prices of horticultural produce, the data base on horticulture is very weak. Despite requests to the State Governments to furnish information about the situation of sensitive horticultural crops on weekly basis, the same has not been forthcoming to the desired extent. Pointing out that availability of timely data is crucial for facilitating decisions having a direct bearing on the farming community, the Agriculture Secretary called upon the State Governments to cooperate in furnishing the required information. He informed the Conference that the work for launching an exclusive TV and radio channel on Agriculture for dissemination of knowledge and Kisan Call Centres for easy access to information is in an advanced stage. These initiatives will have far reaching impact on Indian farmers and make agriculture a knowledge-based enterprise. In his address, the Horticulture Commissioner, Dr. H.P.Singh listed the challenges in the way of achieving the targeted horticultural production of 300 million tonnes by the end of the 11th Plan.. He said that productivity of many horticultural crops continue to be low and post harvest losses continue to be high. Quality of produce needs improvement and resource use efficiency requires upgradation. Although India is ranked second in the world in the production of fruits as well as vegetables, availability of fruits and vegetables still continues to be much below the dietary requirements. Dr. Singh also informed the Conference that bamboo is being declared as a horticultural and plantation crop. The Agriculture Ministry is the nodal Ministry for implementation of the Bamboo Mission. The two-day Conference will review the progress of various horticultural programmes and will also discuss emerging issues to develop a road map for the envisaged horticulture- led transformation. Horticulture Secretaries and Directors from various States, Vice Chancellors of various State Agriculture Universities, horticulture experts, senior officers from various Ministries and representatives of various commodity associations are taking part in the Conference."

469,23-December-2003 18:11 IST,Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment,"Centre To Evolve A Strategy For Effective Implementation Of The Special Component Plan For Scheduled Castes, Says Dr. Satyanarayan Jatiya; State Ministers Meeting In February","The Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment Dr. Satyanarayan Jatiya has said that the Centre will evolve a strategy for effective implementation of the scheme of Special Central Assistance (SCA) to Special Component Plan (SCP) for Scheduled Castes (SCs). Addressing the meeting of the Parliamentary Consultative Committee attached to his Ministry here today, Dr. Jatiya said that a meeting of concerned Ministers of State Governments and Union Territories would be held in February 2004. The Minister said that the states must utilize funds for the purpose for which they are allocated and will have to furnish utilization certificates in time. He said the objective of the SCA is to support SC families to enhance their productivity and income. SCA is an additive to the Special Component Plan and is expected to give a thrust to family oriented schemes of economic development of SCs below the poverty line. It provides resources for filling the critical gaps and bridging the missing vital inputs so that the schemes can be more meaningful. Referring to the good work being done by NGOs in implementing various schemes of the Ministry, Dr. Jatiya said, "" We are working on a system to ensure timely disbursement of funds to NGOs"". He said that a system will have to be evolved for undertaking surprise visits of NGOs by the Ministry. Dr. Jatiya specifically referred to the problems of the aged persons. He said that service delivery to the senior citizens has become a challenging task as resources being limited are not keeping a pace with ever-increasing population of older persons. Reiterating government’s commitment to the welfare of the senior citizens, he suggested that the new year be termed as the Social Security Year of the Aged to focus on better service delivery to them. India is poised to have second largest population of aged persons in the world. Projection studies indicate that the number of persons above 60 years will from the present 76 million increase to 100 million in 2013 and further double to about 200 million in next 17 years ( i.e., upto 2030). The interesting aspect of the aged in India is that 80% of them live in rural areas, thus, making service delivery a challenge. Secondly 30% of senior citizens are living below the poverty line. Thirdly, women would constitute half of the elderly population by 2016. The Members of the Consultative Committee said that the government must give top priority to the rehabilitation and service delivery programmes for the aged and disabled. They said that the Centre must give direction to the states to give matching funds to the Corporations working under the aegis of the Ministry. They said that the NGOs doing good work should be encouraged while those found misusing the funds should be blacklisted. The Ministers of state for Social Justice and Empowerment Shri Kailash Meghwal and Shri Nagmani, the Members of Parliament Shri K H Muniyappa and Shri Kishan Lal Diler participated in the meeting. The Social Justice and Empowerment Secretary Shri B. S. Baswan, other senior officials and the Managing Directors of various Corporation of the Ministry took part in the meeting."

GOA AS PERMANENT VENUE FOR FILM FESTIVAL The Ministry, after consultations with the Goa Government, has decided that Goa will be the permanent venue for the International Film Festival of India (IFFI). The reasons for deciding on a permanent venue were that Film Festivals are known by the cities and not be the countries where the take place and Goa is a well known all over the world. Premier of three Hindi films were introduced first time during the 34th International Film Festival of India-2003, which was held in New Delhi. The Lifetime Achievement Award was conferred upon famous the renowned Italian film actress Liv Ullaman at the festival. In order to encourage foreign film producers to shoot at Indian locations, the Ministry assured to rework on visa manual to provide a single window clearance. This would enable foreign film producers to come to India with a script and leave with the complete films in cans. For this a whole lot of post-production facilities would have to tone up."

482,24-December-2003 17:47 IST,"Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution",Shri Sharad Yadav inaugrates 69th Annual General Meeting of the Indian Sugar Mills Association,"With a view to boosting the export of sugar from the country, the Government has constituted a Committee having members from both the apex bodies of sugar industry and leading exports of sugar. The committee is going to submit its report within 60 days. This was announced by the Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Shri Sharad Yadav while inaugurating 69th Annual General Meeting of the Indian Sugar Mills Association here today. The Minister said to help the sugarcane growers, the Government has taken certain other steps like creation of 20 lakh tonnes of buffer stock for a period of one year w.e.f. December 18, 2002 for which the sugar factories will be reimbursed the carrying cost amounting to Rs. 412 crores from the Sugar Development Fund (SDF). In addition, an amount of Rs. 374 crores has been made available by the banks on account of this buffer stock. Thus, a total amount of Rs. 786 crores is being provided to the mills which will be exclusively utilised for payment of cane price dues of the growers. The periods of this buffer stock has further been extended for another year. This disbursement of the buffer subsidy has already started. Shri Yadav said that the Government has also announced one time assistance of Rs. 678.06 crores to the States of Uttar Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Haryana, Punjab and Bihar to clear the cane price arrears of the private sugar factories in respect of the difference between the State Advised Price (SAP) and Statutory Minimum Price of 2002-2003 sugar season by way of a soft loan to the State Governments at a concessional rate of interest of 4 per cent per annum with an initial moratorium of 3 years and repayable in 3 years thereafter. The Government has further decided to extend assistance to non SAP States by way of additional market borrowings to clear the cane price arrears of 2002-2003 sugar season. The Minister further said that due to drought in many parts of the country, the sugar production in the current season, 2003-2004 would be somewhat lower than the last season. This will to some extent help the industry in reducing the inventory cost. In order to meet the increasing demand of sugarcane which is a renewable source of energy, we must take all possible steps for increasing its production through improvement in productivity, evolution of new high yielding and high sucrose content varieties for different agro-climatic conditions, use of GM technology etc. Government will not only provide financial help from SDF but also technological input through premier technical institutions like ICAR, NSI etc. said Shri Yadav."

484,24-December-2003 16:13 IST,Ministry of Commerce & Industry,Arun Jaitley begins Pre-Exim Policy interactions with Trade & Industry,"Shri Arun Jaitley, Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and Law & Justice has begun the process of pre-Exim policy consultations with trade & industry bodies with first meeting held here today for obtaining inputs for the forthcoming Exim Policy (2004-05) to be announced on 31st March 2004. In a first meeting held with Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO), Shri Jaitley said that new realities of the economy has to be taken into account to make the Exim policy more dynamic. “We have consciously fixed the target of 12% growth in exports this year which will take us to achieve 1% of the global trade by the year 2007”, he said. Shri L. Mansingh, Director General of Foreign Trade and Shri M Rafeeque Ahmed, President of FIEO were present at the meeting along with senior government officials, representatives of trade and industry. Shri Jaitley said that the last year had been very challenging year for India because of the hardening of rupee vis-à-vis US $ since it had made export products costlier. “These are the dynamics of the free market and we have to face and live with it”, he said and complimented the exporting community for their entrepreneurship in the times of adversity. The Minister said that the capacity to cut down costs and improving efficiency was the only way to make Indian products world-beaters. He said that despite the great challenges in the last one-year, several sectors have shown remarkable growth rates including that of services, manufacturing and agriculture. “There has been resurgence in the country’s economy as a whole and the Indian brand must ride on in the world market given the changed perception about India”, Shri Jaitley said. Replying to the suggestions made by FIEO for restoring full 80 HHC benefits, he said that he had already written to the Finance Minister about the issue and would meet again to review the situation. Shri Rafeeque Ahmed urged the Minister to give a boost to exporting units in the Domestic Tariff Area (DTA) by treating those which export more than 75% of their production at par with 100% EOUs in the matter of facilities and benefits, including Green Card etc. He also requested the Minister to advise the ECGC to settle 100% of the exporters’ claims, instead of the current 90% claims, in cases where payments are not realized from the buyer. In this way, he said, the exporters can be reassured that they would not be losing any share of the benefits associated with exports. He also made a strong plea for reduction in processing fees by banks etc., and also in withdrawal or lowering of State levies on exports so that the exporters’ transaction cost could be cut drastically. FIEO Vice President, Shri Subhash Mittal, appealed to the Minister to personally intervene on behalf of the exporters to seek some immediate remedial measures to protect exporters’ interests against the appreciating rupee. The continuing loss to exporters on account of the rising rupee, he said, could be reduced by restoring full 80-HHC benefits on export proceeds repatriation, and through allowing weighted deduction for expenditure on marketing. Besides, he said, exporters can be helped under the present circumstances by making Dollar loans at LIBOR+75 basis point easily available to them. In addition to seeking such finance-related remedies, the President of FIEO also appealed to the Commerce Minister to relax the criterion set for grant of recognition status to exporters as even many of the existing status holders could find themselves disqualified after March 2004, as a consequence of the fall in their exports due to the appreciating rupee."
485,24-December-2003 16:17 IST,Ministry of Information & Broadcasting,Delhi Chief Minister charges on CAS unfounded,"The attention of the Ministry of I&B has been drawn to news items in a number of daily newspapers quoting the Chief Minister of Delhi Smt. Sheila Dikshit as stating in the Delhi Assembly that rejected and inferior technology was being imported from a single foreign company and being imposed on the people of Delhi, in the process of implementation of CAS. The Chief Minister is also quoted as having told the Assembly that the Ministry of I&B does not have any plan of action and there is total confusion. The Chief Minister, according to Press reports, said the manner in which CAS was sought to be implemented had raised doubts about the motives behind the whole move. The above statements are unwarranted and do not at all represent the factual position. The technology for the manufacture of Set Top Boxes does not at present exist in India and this has been confirmed on a number of occasions by representatives of the Indian Electronic Industry in the course of meetings with officials of the Ministry of I&B. CETMA (Consumer Electronics and TV Manufacturers Association), in their last meeting with the Ministry of I&B on 11.12.2003, had confirmed that Indian industry would only be able to manufacture set top boxes if there was a guarantee of sufficient volumes, a situation that could come about if CAS is implemented in several cities. As far as the import of set top boxes is concerned, these have been imported directly by different MSOs from reputed manufacturers namely, (1) Hundon (Korea)-Siticable; (2) Humax (Korea)-Hathway; (3) Konax (Norway)-Siticable; (4) Nagravision/Hindujas, (5) C-Net (China)/Trinity (formerly the Spectranet). A team of highly qualified Engineers from BECIL (Broadcast Engineering Consultants India Limited), a Public Sector Undertaking under the Ministry of I&B, was sent to Korea to inspect the manufacturing facilities and to report on quality control measures undertaken by the manufactures. The team visited the Plant of Humax at Seoul in the fist week of July, 2003 and has confirmed that the boxes were being manufactured according to stipulated quality standards. Boxes imported into India were also subject to random checking of their technical specifications by BECIL and it has been confirmed that these meet the norms of the Bureau of Indian Standards specified for set top boxes. The Chief Minister of Delhi, Smt. Sheila Dikshit had a meeting with Minister for I&B during which It was emphasized that in the implementation of CAS, the State Government along with its machinery has to play an effective role. This position was acknowledged by the Chief Minister herself. If there are any specific complaints the nodal officers appointed by State Government like SDM/Deputy Commissioner with due corporation of I&B officers will address. It is totally incorrect to say that the Ministry of I&B has no plan of action or that it is confused about its approach. The implementation of CAS in south Delhi is an immediate consequence of the order of the Delhi High Court dated 4th December, 2003 and the Chief Minister was apprised of this fact when she met the I&B Minister on 22nd December, 2003. The Ministry of I&B is fully aware of its responsibilities in the implementation of CAS, and has in turn requested the State Governments concerned for their full co-operation."

The Ministry of Rural Development has instituted annual awards for Best Performing Panchayats. On promoting rural sanitation Ministry has launched ‘Nirmal Gram Puraskar’. Along with this Vigilance and Monitoring Committees have been reconstituted with greater involvement of Members of Parliament. WASTELANDS DEVELOPMENT A new initiative ‘Hariyali’ was launched in January 2003 for watershed programmes being implemented through Panchayati Raj Institutions. Under this initiative, all ongoing area development programmes namely, Integrated Wastelands Development Programme (IWDP), Drought Prone Areas Programme (DPAP) and Desert Development Programme (DDP) will be implemented through Panchayati Raj Institutions w.e.f. April 2003. The budget provision for the Department of Land Resources which was about Rs.300 crore in 1997-2000 was enhanced to Rs. 900 crore in the last two years (2000-2002). It has further been enhanced to Rs.1,050 crore for the year 2003-04. During the current year, the Ministry has sanctioned 2535 new watershed projects under DPAP, 1630 new watershed projects under DDP and 1094 watershed projects under IWDP with the total cost of Rs. 1577.70 crore for implementation as per provisions of the guidelines for ‘Hariyali’. RURAL DRINKING WATER A new initiative named as Swajaldhara was launched by the Prime Minister on December 25, 2002 for providing of drinking water to all the villages in the shortest possible time at minimum cost. Under the scheme, 10 per cent of the cost of the project would be contributed by the villagers while the remaining 90 per cent would be borne by the Union Government. In case of villages /Panchayats where SC/ST population is at least 50 percent of the total population, the contribution of the community will be five percent. The Swajaldhara programme is an extension of reform initiative in rural drinking water supply where the community will plan, implement, operate, maintain and manage the asset. The Ministry has been mandated to make provision of safe drinking water to all habitations by 2004. Under Accelerated Rural Water Supply Programme (ARWSP), the budgetary support has been increased from Rs.1,960 crore in 2000-01 to Rs. 2535 crore in 2003-04, which is more than 40 per cent increase over 1998-99. Out of the total number of 14.22 lakh rural habitations in the country, almost 93.74 per cent rural habitations are fully covered with drinking water facility, about 5.52 per cent habitations are partially covered and only about 10,489 habitations are not covered. As per the announcement made by the Prime Minister in his Independence Day address to the nation on August 15, 2002, three programmes viz (I) installation of one lakh hand pumps, (ii) providing drinking water facility to one lakh rural primary schools, and (iii) revival of one lakh traditional sources of water have been launched. The schemes will be completed in two years 2003-2004 and 2004-2005. SAMPOORNA GRAMEEN ROZGAR YOJANA (SGRY) Gainful employment, food security and strengthening of infrastructure in rural areas is a must for national renewal for a resurgent India. The Prime Minister launched an ambitious scheme on September 25, 2001 to provide additional employment in rural areas under the Sampoorna Grameen Rozgar Yojana (SGRY) with an annual outlay of Rs.10,000 crore.

PRADHAN MANTRI GRAM SADAK YOJANA (PMGSY) Rural roads are vital to economic growth and poverty alleviation in rural areas. The Prime Minister launched the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) on December 25, 2000, with the objective of providing road connectivity through good all-weather roads to all unconnected habitations having a population of more than 1,000 persons by the year 2003 and those with a population of more than 500 persons by the end of the Tenth Plan period (2007). An investment of about Rs.60,000 crore is envisaged. The scheme entails connecting about 1.6 lakh habitations in addition to the existing rural roads.

Efforts are being made to end the shelterlessness by the end of the Tenth Plan period. During 2003-2004, the Central allocation under Indira Awaas Yojana (IAY)/Credit-cum-Subsidy Scheme for Rural Housing (CCSS)/ Samagra Awaas Yojana (SAY) is Rs. 1870.50 crore for construction/upgradation of 14,84,554 houses. During the current financial year, an amount of Rs. 994.96 crore has been released under the Scheme so far. RURAL SANITATION PROGRAMME A Total Sanitation Campaign has been launched in 1999 to suit district specific requirements. The campaign is now being implemented in 374 districts with an outlay of Rs. 3604.82 crore. Under the Total Sanitation Campaign, 44.33 lakh individual household toilets, 1817 sanitary complexes for women, 47,825 toilets for schools and 5,429 Balwadi toilets have been constructed so far. In order to emphasise on promoting rural sanitation and involving all the stake holders, Ministry of Rural Development has launched ‘Nirmal Gram Puraskar’. Under the scheme, Panchayati Raj Institutions who are successful in eliminating the practice of open defecation will be rewarded. EMPOWERING THE PANCHAYATI RAJ INSTITUTIONS Panchayats have been recognised as the backbone for the development of Indian villages. To mark the celebration of ten years since the passing of the Constitution (73rd Amendment Act), Ministry has instituted annual awards for Best Performing Panchayats. The award will be given to 6 District Panchayats, 12 Intermediate Panchayats and 50 Gram Panchayats. A national consensus is being developed to devolve more powers amongst the Panchayati Raj Institutions so as to make them vibrant local bodies at the grassroots level. MONITORING The Ministry of Rural Development has reconstituted Vigilance and Monitoring Committees at the State/Districts Levels with greater involvement of Members of Parliament. These Committees monitor the implementation of the programmes and introduce greater transparency in the same.

506,29-December-2003 15:28 IST,Ministry of Steel,Steel Sector in 2003,"Year-End ReviewThe Indian Iron and Steel Industry, during the year 2003, has touched a new high both in terms of profitability and value for investment. With emerging buoyancy in the steel market, both public and private sector units have increased their profits. The total production of finished steel during January-November, 2003 has been provisionally estimated at 31.911 million tonnes as against 29.076 million tonnes during January-November 2002 showing increase of about 9.75 per cent. Pig iron production during this period was about 4.921 million tonnes as against 4.336 million tonnes during the same period last year showing an increase of 13.49 per cent. The availability of finished steel during the period has been 27.011 million tonnes as compared to the figures of 25.749 million tonnes for the same period last year showing an increase of 4.9 per cent. The apparent consumption of finished steel during the year has been 27.326 million tonnes against 25.868 million tonnes during the last year recording a growth of 5.63 per cent. The industry has been successful in diversifying the export distributions to new areas in Asia, Africa and Middle East. Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL), this year has geared up to achieve all-time best production levels. The upward trend in almost all performance parameters of the company indicates the inner strength to achieve a turnaround at the end of this fiscal. It achieved highest ever production of saleable steel in 2002-03 with production level crossing 10 million tonne mark for the first time. During April-November, 2003 saleable steel production (including IISCO) was 73.3 lakh tonne as against 67.9 lakh tonne in the corresponding period last year with an improvement of 8 per cent. It recorded a 15 per cent rise in sales during the months of October and November 2003. During the year, there has been a steady increase in demand for SAIL's product, in both long and flat product categories. The Steel Ministry has planned to meet the increasing needs of iron ore by the major steel companies by 2012. Accordingly, the SAIL will develop two large iron ore mines to produce 10-11 million tonnes of ore per annum at Chiria in Jharkhand and Rowghat in Chhattisgarh to meet its internal requirements. Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RNIL) will also add to its captive mines. Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP), another public sector unit which staged a turnaround last year, during April-November, 2003, has achieved a record sales turnover of Rs.3541 crore and earned a profit of more than Rs.500 crore. In many fields the plant has shown an excellent performance. Public sector National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC) earned a net profit of Rs.245.87 (before tax) during this period against a target of Rs.202.38 crore. It produced 105.75 lakh tonnes of iron ore and 39,600 carrots of diamond during this period achieving 92 and 73 per cent of the target respectively, and sold nearly 122.34 lakh tonnes of iron ore and 51,334 carrots of diamond. It ranked among top ten public sector enterprises of the country. Deputy Prime Minister, Shri L.K. Advani laid the foundation stone of the world's first commercial Romelt plant at Nagarnar in Chhattisgarh on September 23, 2003. The plant, being set up by Romelt-SAIL (India) Limited (RSIL) for its client NMDC, is scheduled to be commissioned in about two years time. Manganese Ore (India) Limited (MOIL), the single largest producer of high grade manganese ore in the country achieved a sales turnover of Rs.134.46 crore during the period and earned net profit of Rs.15.44 crore. Metals Scrap Trading Corporation (MSTC) has earned a net profit of Rs.9.71 crore during this period while its subsidiary Ferro Scrap Nigam Limited earned a profit after tax of Rs.1.99 crore during the same period. Public sector Bharat Refactories Limited (BRL) has registered cash profit of Rs.173.68 lakh till November, 2003. The company is expected to close the year with net profit for the first time. The production of the company during April-November, 2003 has increased to 38,299 tonnes from 21,119 tonnes during the same period last year with a growth of more than 81 per cent. The Government provided a revival package to the company in 2002. Under the revival package for Indian Iron and Steel Company Limited (IISCO), the Government has released Rs.186 crore grant to implement voluntary retirement scheme in Kulti Works. 2544 employees have already been released and operation of the Kulti Works has been closed from April 2003. Government of India has also extended its guarantee to IISCO for raising a loan of Rs.341 crore for meeting capital expenditure in Burnpur Works of IISCO and Collieries & Mines of IISCO and Rs. 90 crore for VRS in these units. IISCO entered into capital market during September-October, 2003 and has raised Rs.64 crore. Almost all the private sector plants registered growth during the year 2003. Tata Iron & Steel Company Limited (TISCO) posted a profit growth of 98.40 per cent in the second quarter of this financial year backed by higher volumes, richer product-mix, improved realisation and efficiency. The company has planned a mega expansion during the year to treble the capacity from 4 million tonnes to 12 million tonnes by the year 2010. The Steel Ministry has decided to formulate the National Steel Policy for drawing up a road map for this sector in context of second generation reforms, restructuring and globalisation. A Committee under the chairmanship of Development Commissioner for Iron & Steel, Kolkata has prepared the first draft of the policy, which is being examined in consultation with the steel producers and associations. The Ministry is taking up promotion of steel usage in construction, steel scaffolding in place of bamboo scaffolding, development of welding centres in rural areas, truck bodies made of steel, popularizing steel drums and silos to preserve food grains and roofing railway platforms. Biju Patnaik National Steel Institute (BPNSI) has been established at Puri to cater to the needs of training, service, consultancy and research and development of the steel producing belt of southern and eastern region. In the domestic market, the Ministry has taken up the cause of creating incremental demand for steel through intensive programmes seeking to promote consumption of steel. In a proactive bid to boost demand for steel, various specialist institutions such as, the INSDAG and the BPNSI have been created. The Ministry has taken steps to energise the National Institute of Secondary Steel Technology (NISST) at Mandi Gobind Garh to meet the training, consultancy and R&D needs of re-rolling industry. The iron and steel plants both in public and in private sector, research laboratories, academic institutions continue to do their R&D activities to develop new processes and products. The Empowered Committee has met eight times and has approved 30 research projects worth Rs.211.95 crore. Out of this Rs.100.56 crore is to be met from Steel Development Fund (SDF). So far approximately Rs.62.0 crore has been disbursed. During the period many countries imposed trade barriers and US embargo was a big blow to the industry. Government of India at its own level and in collaboration with the affected parties approached the US Commerce Department for a possible re-look into the case. During the year the steel prices across the board have gone up right from intermediaries to finished products and the international prices have firmed up. These have contributed to make Indian exports more viable. Net sales realisations which were on severe pressure till the beginning of the year, have improved significantly. With all these, steel sector is poised to register a growth of 6 per cent during the current fiscal."

511,30-December-2003 11:22 IST,Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation,International Award in Statistics instituted GREEN ACCOUNTING MAKES ITS WAY UTILISATION OF MPLADS FUNDS CROSSED 80% MARK COST OVER-RUNS FURTHER REDUCED,"Year-End Review-2003 Statistics Wing The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation has instituted a biennial international award in memory of eminent statistician Prof. P.C. Mahalanobis to recognise the lifetime contribution of eminent statisticians from developing countries and to promote the best statistical practices. The award consists of a cash prize of US$ 5000. Mahalanobis Committee on International Award in Statistics (MCIAS) has been formed to consider the nominations. According to existing practice, the GDP does not take into account the assessment of the cost of the negative environmental impact of the development. In this regard, the CSO had launched a pilot project on Natural Resource Accounting in Goa in April 1999 the report of which is under study. Meanwhile, an Action Plan for preparation of Natural Resource Accounting and estimation of Green Accounting in the country has been prepared by Expert Group. Four more such environmental impact studies would be done in seven States on air, water, land and forests. The National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) has released a series of reports based on its 57th Round survey on unorganised service sector enterprises along with regular household consumer expenditure and employment-unemployment situation. The fieldwork for the survey was conducted during July 2001 to June 2002. This is for the second time only after 22 years that NSSO has made an independent attempt to cover the entire gamut of service sector activities (except trade and finance). The survey implicitly included the non-profit-distributing units. Consumer expenditure surveys under National Sample Survey (NSS) constitute the source data for the Planning Commission to estimate the people below the poverty line in the country. The Year-long survey of 59th Round that started in January 2003 is covering subjects like land and livestock holdings and debt & investment. The Situation Assessment Survey – ‘A Millennium Study of Indian Farmers’ is also being conducted along with the 59th Round. NSSO has started compiling literacy rates based on the data on educational status collected in the consumer expenditure schedule, so as to give the estimates of literacy rates for the intervening period of two population censuses. A Bill based on National Statistical Commission’s recommendation for constitution of a National Commission on Statistics was introduced in the Parliament and sent to the respective Standing Committees for consideration. Also, as a follow up on the recommendations of the National Statistical Commission for improvement of Regional Accounts Statistics, four regional level workshops were conducted during the year for the benefit of State Directorate of Economics and Statistics engaged in the compilation of the estimates of state income and related aggregates. The annual publication ‘National Accounts Statistics – 2003, containing estimates of National Income & other Allied Aggregates for the years 1993-94 to 2001-02 both at current and constant (1993-94) prices was brought out during the year. The publication also includes quarterly estimates of GDP and update of advance estimates of national income for 2002-03. Comparable estimates of Gross and Net State Domestic Product (GSDP/NSDP) and corresponding per capita estimates for the year 2000-01 for each State were prepared and sent to the Finance Commission and the Planning Commission for their use. MPLADS As on 30th November 2003, an amount of Rs. 11880.30 crore has been released under the scheme to the District Collectors out of which Rs. 9531.7 crore have been spent. Between April 2003 and November 2003 Rs. 1382.50 crore were released of which 80.2% money has been utilized. After taking into consideration the suggestions of MPs and the district authorities, a comprehensive review of the Guidelines has been done. The proposed revised Guidelines in this regard are now with the MPLADS Committees of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha for consideration. Special software developed for monitoring of MPLAD works was tested in Mathura and now has been supplied to nine district authorities in different States. After it is found successful the software will be supplied to all the districts in the country and States’ nodal departments. The progress of MPLADS specially in North-Eastern States is being reviewed by the Minister himself. Monitoring of Projects As on 31.11.2003, out of 282 Major and Mega projects costing Rs. 100 crore and above, 41 are ahead, 75 are on schedule and 104 are delayed as per their latest approved schedule. 21 major and mega projects were completed between April to November and 168 additional projects are likely to be completed during the year 2003-04. The pro-active measures observed by the Ministry in recent times have brought about improvement in the project implementation scenario. For the projects under monitoring of the Ministry in November 2003, the overall cost over-run was only 6.4%. The percentage of delay for these projects was 37.5. Timely implementation of projects depends on the knowledge and leadership styles of project managers who bring in place a plan on paper into reality in a given cost and time frame. With this idea in the center, the Ministry with several other organizations organized twelfth annual symposium on Project Management, ‘Taming the Future through Project Management’ being the theme. Twenty Point Programme Monitoring of the progress of Twenty Point Programme (TPP-86) is another thrust area of the Ministry. Gujarat and Rajasthan have topped among States by achieving 100% targets in 2002-03. This was indicated in the annual progress report. Himachal Pradesh and Haryana follow these States with 91% and 89% achievements respectively. Arunachal Pradesh and Assam achieved only 27% of their respective targets of TPP-86 and were ranked 29th on the scored board."

514,30-December-2003 14:51 IST,Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment,Empowerment of weaker sections through quality educationBABA SAHEB DR. AMBEDKAR’S PARIVIRVAN STHAL DEDICATED TO THE NATION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF DR. AMBEDKAR NATIONAL MEMORIALSETTING UP OF 100 SOCIAL JUSTICE CENTRESCONSTITUTION OF THE NATIONAL COMMISSION FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES,"YEAR-END REVIEW 2003 Empowerment through education with emphasis on quality education particularly for Scheduled Castes and minorities has been the focus of the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment during 2003. This is to enable the youth belonging to Scheduled Castes to be able to compete on their own merit in the job markets in new dispensation of globalisation and liberalisation. This aspect of the Ministry’s new thinking was highlighted recently by the Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee. He told the Members of Parliament belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes that we have to make students belonging to SC/ST communities highly qualified so that they can come up the social ladder without the crutches of reservation. The Ministry has taken several initiatives and many more are in the pipeline. It launched Dr. Ambedkar National Scholarships Scheme for meritorious SC/ST students in order to encourage a spirit of achieving excellence among them. To begin with 193 students belonging to SC and 94 from ST Communities having secured highest marks in regular 10th Class examination conducted by 19 Education Boards/ Councils in the country were given scholarships involving an expenditure of Rs.69.40 lakh this year. The award of scholarships in the remaining states and UTs is in process. The Ministry allocated 40 crore rupees as 100% assistance to states for arranging remedial and special coaching for SC/ST students studying in class !X to XII. While remedial coaching aims at removing deficiencies in school subjects, special coaching is provided with a view to prepare students for competitive examinations for entry into professional courses like engineering, medical etc. The Ministry finances yet another scheme for providing free coaching facilities to eligible SC students to compete successfully in the competitive examinations. About thirteen thousand beneficiaries were helped through this scheme during 2002-03. The Post-Matric Scholarship Scheme for SC students, which has emerged as the biggest educational scholarship scheme of the Government of India, was amended to link scholarship rates with Consumer Price Index of Industrial Workers and increasing the income ceiling for eligibility. Rs. 1544.40 crore have been earmarked for the Scheme during the 10th Plan. More than 153 crore rupees were released for the Post-matric Scholarship Scheme during 2002-03. About 19.26 lakh Scheduled Caste students are expected to benefit from the scheme during the current financial year. Similarly under Pre-Matric Scholarship Scheme, an anticipated 4.64 lakh beneficiaries are to get the benefit during 2003-04. The scheme assists the children of scavengers, flayers and tanners irrespective of their religion, to pursue education upto matriculation level. . Rs. 87 crore have been allocated for this Scheme during the current Plan. Two new schemes for promotion of quality education are on the anvil. These are setting up of residential schools for SC students in high concentration SC districts for which Rs.10 crore have already been earmarked in current budget and Government to arrange admission in public schools of deserving SC students and meet the costs to this effect. Persons with disabilities and minorities were also on the centre stage of the Ministry’s educational empowerment schemes. National Scholarship Scheme for Persons with Disabilities has been started to award 500 scholarships each year for pursuing technical and higher education. 180 scholarships were awarded in February 2003. The Prime Minster Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee launched three schemes for the educational development of minorities, viz., Maulana Abdul Kalam Azad Literacy Awards Scheme, Maulana Azad National Scholarship Scheme and Establishment of Maulana Azad Sadbhawna Kendras Scheme. Under the Maulana Abdul Kalam Azad Literacy Awards Scheme, four awards would be given every year to reputed organisations/institutions for their outstanding contribution in promoting education, particularly among girls belonging to educationally backward minorities. The Maulana Azad National scholarship Scheme is to assist meritorious girl students belonging to minorities who cannot continue their education without financial support. Under this scheme, a scholarship of Rs. 10,000 each is being given to 1200 selected girl students during the current financial year. Under the Scheme of Financial Assistance for Establishment of Maulana Azad Sadbhawna Kendras, universities, reputed academic and research institutions and local bodies are to be given a maximum grant of Rs. 10 lakh. Economic Empowerment Yet other important initiatives have been for the economic development of people belonging to Scheduled Castes, OBCs and minorities. The Ministry has allocated major part of its resources for the welfare of the Scheduled Castes. Rs. 5,786 crore constituting two thirds of the total 10th Plan outlay has been provided for the scheduled castes development. The allocation is over Rs. 2,216 crore more than the amount released for the welfare of the Scheduled caste during the IXth plan. In the first year of the Xth plan Rs. 9,44.82 crore were provided for implementation of the schemes meant for the development of the Scheduled Castes. Even the other programmes that are not exclusively for Scheduled Castes and OBCs are primarily directed towards the most disadvantaged groups of population living in backward, rural and urban slum areas. Welfare of Backward Classes The Government notified 17 advices received from the National Commission for Backward Classes for inclusion in the Central List of Backward Classes during this year These advices pertained to Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, Karnataka, Orissa, Rajasthan, West Bengal and Chandigarh. The Ministry asked the National Commission for Backward Classes to review the income criteria for excluding the Creamy Layer from amongst the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and also to evolve a formula for periodic revision of criteria and income ceiling for determining the Creamy Layer. The Prime Minister announced setting up of a Commission to study the problems for Denotified communities and Nomadic and Semi-nomadic communities. The Commission would identify these communities state-wise, study their socio-economic needs and recommend specific interventions required for their overall development. Ambedkar National Memorial The Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee dedicated to the nation Baba Saheb Dr. Ambedkar’s Parivirvan Sthal at the 26 Alipur Road in Delhi where Baba Saheb lived from 1st November, 1951 to 6th December, 1956 when he breathed his last. The Prime Minister also inaugurated the development work of the Dr. Ambedkar National Memorial which would be developed into a Museum. Ambedkar Foundation has translated and published Baba Saheb’s works in Hindi, Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Oriya, Punjabi, Tamil, Telegu & Urdu. Mainstreaming Minorities Mainstreaming of minorities received added impetus with a sharp increase in grant of concessional loans to poorer sections among them for income generating activities. A study revealed that 77 percent of beneficiaries of the loans sanctioned by the National Minorities Development and Finance Corporation (NMDFC) constituted Muslims. As already stated above, promotion of education among minorities has received equal importance. NMFDC has launched a scheme whereby students belonging to minority communities are provided educational loan upto Rs. 75,000 at 3% rate of interest. The Central Wakf Council sanctioned nine Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) under the newly launched scheme for imparting technical/ vocational training to poor Muslims. Five of these ITIs have been sanctioned in Uttar Pradesh, three in Bihar and one in Orissa. One of the ITIs located at Azamgarh in Uttar Pradesh is exclusively for girl students while the remaining ITIs will have both male and female trainees. A National Convention on Educational and Economic Development of Minorities was held in New Delhi after 38 years. Welfare of the Persons with Disabilities The Government notified the Constitution of the National Commission for Persons with Disabilities. This has been done in pursuance with the announcement made by the Prime Minister for the welfare of the persons with disabilities on the Independence Day. The Nine-member Commission would recommend to the Central Government specific programme of action for facilitating full participation of the persons with disabilities in the social and economic life of the country. This would involve provision of right education, vocational training and poverty elevation packages, employment and other support services so that the disabled persons are assessed for their abilities. The Commission would also review the status and conditions of Institutions delivering services in the disability sector. New Delhi hosted 6th International Abilympics featuring participation of more than 3,000 contestants from over 50 countries. It highlighted the importance of education and vocational training for the disabled by providing an ideal platform for the participants to get an exposure of the latest technology in job oriented skills which, in turn, helps in their inclusion into the mainstream of society. The Artificial Limbs Manufacturing Corporation of India (ALIMCO), Kanpur organised camps in Assam, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh to distribute aids and appliances to persons with disabilities with poor among them getting aids and appliances free of cost. The objective of the scheme is to eliminate some problems of daily living by the persons with disabilities by making them available suitable, durable and standard aids and appliances. Over hundred thirty districts have been identified for providing comprehensive rehabilitation services at the doorsteps of persons with disabilities. Services identified include setting up of composite rehabilitation and facilitation centres in collaboration with district authorities and utilizing existing resources. 85 District Centres have become functional. Social Justice Centres 100 social Justice Centres announced by the Prime Minister on Independence Day are being primarily set up at district level for the welfare and empowerment of disabled and weaker sections of society. These centres are to help target groups of the various schemes in rehabilitation and training. The Social Justice centre would also help in creating awareness about various schemes aimed at empowerment and economic upliftment of the marginalised sections of the society. Social Defence Social Defence also witnessed several initiatives to strengthen and expand programmes for providing care and protection to such segments of society, which are victims of destitution, neglect and abandonment such as children and the aged. Several concessions have been extended to senior citizens by various Ministries/Departments at the behest of the Ministry of social Justice and Empowerment. These include uniform age for male and female for availing rail travel concession, priority in getting medical care, telephone connections, higher interest on deposits, and concessions in payment of taxes. The Ministry’s 24-hour free phone service for children in distress has been extended to 55 cities. There has been sixty percent increase in funds to NGOs for rehabilitation of street children. Under the Integrated Programme for Street Children the Ministry is currently supporting 207 NGOs in 21 states/UTs working on an average with 300 children in each project. A three-day International Meet on Adoption was organised by the Central Adoption Resource Agency, CARA, in New Delhi in which delegates from 15 countries representing the foreign governments and adoption agencies apart from representatives of the Government of India, State Governments, Union Territories and Indian NGOs participated. The Meet was the first ever programme in India to share experiences with different receiving countries and their Central Authorities who have either ratified or signed Hague Convention and have adoption programmes with India."
515,30-December-2003 14:16 IST,Ministry of Commerce & Industry,Industry on buoyant path with sustained high growth,"Year End Review - IndustryIndustrial growth in India has reached a stage in the year 2003 where all the ingredients are in place to trigger an era of high growth. The combination of low inflation, low interest rates, tax buoyancy, high import growth and a revival of public spending on infrastructure together signal a likelihood of a significant acceleration in overall growth and industrial growth in particular. The configuration of monetary and fiscal parameters today provides an assurance of stability. Investor sentiment is on upswing and equities have shown strong rally with inflation continue to be subdued. The Business Confidence Index is on high, a reflection of feel good factor in the economy. These are the highlights of the industrial sector during the year 2003. The industrial recovery witnessed during 2002 has continued during the current year as well with overall industrial growth (measured in terms of the Index of Industrial Production) growing at a rate of 5.8% during the first half of 2003 (April-September) compared with 5.4% achieved during the same period last year. The manufacturing sector posted a growth of 6.3% followed by 4.2% by mining & quarrying and 2.9% by electricity sector during April-September this year. In a major initiative to enhance global competitiveness of domestic industries, the government announced in December 2003, the Industrial Infrastructure Upgradation Scheme (IIUS) by providing quality infrastructure in selected functional clusters/locations. With a provision of Rs. 675 crore in the Tenth Plan, the scheme will be taken up in 20-25 clusters for development. The assistance will be by way of one time grant-in-aid to the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) formed by the cluster association for development of the infrastructure. It is expected that this initiative will pave the way for domestic industries to become globally competitive. Foreign Direct Investment into India is on rise. According to UNCTAD’s World Investment Report 2003, FDI inflow to India has risen to US $ 3.45 billion in 2002 from US $ 3.40 billion in 2001, though there was a fall in the FDI inflows across the world during the same time. India’s share in world FDI has been steadily increasing from 0.17% in 2000 to 0.41% in 2001 and to 0.53% in 2002 (latest available data). Progressive liberalisation of FDI policy has strengthened investor confidence with opening up of new sectors like integrated townships, defence industry, tea plantations etc; and sectoral reforms/deregulation in telecom sector etc. From this year, the government started complying with the international norms of measuring FDI, according to which, FDI into India touched US $ 4.66 billion (revised figure) as against US $ 2.57 billion in 2002-03. Investments by Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) have shown a significant increase on account of economic recovery. According to latest Reserve Bank of India data, FII inflow during April-September 2003-04 was to the tune of US $ 3.44 billion against an outflow of US $ 379 million during the same period of the previous year. In order to simplify and rationalise the procedure governing grant of patents, the government has introduced the Patents (Amendment) Bill 2003 in December 2003 in the Parliament to further amend the Patents Act, 1970 so as to make the system more user-friendly. Moreover, the Patents Rules 2003 has come into force with effect from 20.5.2003. The Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999 and the Trade Marks Act 1999 also came into force on 15.9.2003 along with setting up of the Intellectual Property Appellate Board in Chennai. This Act makes the Indian Patent Law not only TRIPs-compliant but also incorporates safeguards for protection of public interest and public health as provided in the Doha Declaration. It also incorporates provisions for protection of bio-diversity and traditional knowledge. Apart from legislative changes in relevant IP laws, the Government’s initiatives throughout the year have included major upgradation and modernisation of the administrative framework covering Patents, Designs, Trade Marks and Geographical Indications. Projects to modernise the Patent Office, the Design Offices, the Trade Marks Registries and the establishment of a new Geographical Indications Registry have been taken up. Comprehensive computerisation has been undertaken in order to improve the functioning of Patent Offices. The year 2003 also saw the finalisation of the report of the Govindarajan Committee, which was set up to suggest simplification in procedures for investment approval and implementation of projects. In its two-part reports, the committee recommended reengineering of regulatory projects, setting up of Industrial Investment Facilitation Board (IIFB) to help resolve difficulties faced during implementation, ways to dismantle ‘Inspector-Raj’ and action plan for greater use of information technology to usher in transparency. Another highlight of the year was the feel good factor in the economy, which has pushed the Business Confidence Index (BCI) to a new high. According to National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) latest quarterly survey the BCI has jumped to 129.4 in October 2003 as compared to 82.5 in October 2001 and 102.4 in October 2002. Similarly, Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry’s (FICCI) Business Confidence Index too has increased to 76.2 in the second quarter of the current financial year from 69.4 in the same period of the previous year. Thus, the overall investment climate as seen in the year 2003 is propitious to promote growth and investment in industry as reflected in buoyant investment indicators."
516,30-December-2003 14:20 IST,Ministry of Agriculture,Agriculture in 2003,"YEAR END REVIEW-2003 After last year’s severe drought, favourable monsoon has brought cheer to the agriculture sector this year. The failure of monsoon saw the foodgrains production during 2002-03 falling to an estimated 182.57 million tonnes from a record level of 212. 02 million tonnes during the previous year. However, the revival of prospects this year is already evident in the foodgrains production during the Kharif season, estimated at 108.45 million tonnes. The production of oilseeds has been estimated at 15.08 million tones as against 9.22 million tonnes in the previous year. During 2003, the Agriculture Ministry took a number of steps to increase the production and productivity and also for the welfare of farmers. Some of the important initiatives are as follows: REDUCTION IN INTEREST RATE ON FARM LOANS Farmers now will have to pay a maximum interest rate of 9% on bank loans up to Rs.50,000 for each crop. Earlier, they had to pay a rate of 14 to 18%. Emphasis has been laid on providing timely and adequate credit to farmers for increasing agricultural production and productivity. FARM INCOME INSURANCE PROGRAMME A pilot project of the Farm Income Insurance Programme has been launched during the 2003-04 Rabi season. It covers the two critical components of the farmer’s income, namely yield and price through a single policy instrument. The minimum guaranteed income is determined by using the average yield of the last seven years and the minimum support price. MINIMUM SUPPORT PRICES: While fixing the minimum support prices of various Kharif and Rabi crops, a conscious effort was made to offer relatively higher increase in pulses and oilseeds vis-à-vis rice and wheat. This was considered necessary, as despite some efforts at diversification in the past, no significant increase in the area under pulses and oilseeds vis-à-vis the traditional rice- wheat system took place. While fixing the MSP for various Rabi pulses and oilseeds, a substantial increase ranging from Rs.180 to Rs.270 was effected. PACKAGE FOR SUGARCANE FARMERS: The Government announced a one time assistance of Rs.678.06 crore to State Governments to mitigate hardships of the sugarcane farmers who have not been paid sugarcane arrears for the 2002-03 season by private sector sugarcane factories in Uttar Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Bihar, Punjab and Haryana. The assistance is in the nature of soft loans at a concessional rate of interest of 4 per cent with an initial moratorium of 3 years and repayable within three years thereafter. The assistance is intended to clear the arrears arising out of the difference between the Statutory Minimum Price and the State Advised Price. NATIONAL HORTICULTURE MISSION The Prime Minister announced the launching of the National Horticulture Mission in his Independence Day address to the nation this year. The Mission aims at giving impetus to cultivation of fruits, vegetables, flowers, spices, etc. The target is to double the horticulture production in the country by 2010. The on-going centrally sponsored scheme of “Technology Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture in the North-Eastern States including Sikkim” has been extended to Jammu and Kashmir, Uttaranchal and Himachal Pradesh. MODEL LAW ON AGRICULTURAL MARKETING: A model law on agricultural marketing has been formulated. It has been sent to the States for follow up action. The main features of the Act are as follows: <U+F0B7> Legal persons, growers and local authorities permitted to establish new markets in any area. <U+F0B7> No compulsion of growers to sell their produce through the existing regulated markets. <U+F0B7> Establishment of direct purchase centres and Consumers/Farmers Markets for direct sale. <U+F0B7> A separate chapter to regulate and promote contract farming arrangements in the country. <U+F0B7> Prohibition of a commission agency in any transaction of agricultural commodities with producers. <U+F0B7> Constitution of State Marketing Standards Bureau for promotion of grading, standardization and quality certification of agricultural produce. PROJECT ON TRANSGENICS: A network project on transgenics covering 12 crops has been prepared. The proposed research project of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) will cover maize, pigeonpea, chickpea, soyabean, cotton, brassica, tomato, brinjal, banana, papaya, potato and cassava. The proposed project would focus on specially targeted trait improvement such as resistance to insect pests, fungal diseases and viral diseases, tolerance to abiotic stresses and extended shelf life in each of the 12 crops. CALL CENTRE SCHEME A Call Centre Scheme has been mooted to enable farmers in any part of the country to obtain any agricultural information required by them. The facility will be available free of cost. The scheme is likely to be introduced in January, 2004. AGRI-CHANNEL The work for launching a Radio and Television channel for dissemination of knowledge is in an advanced stage. The Channel is likely to be launched in January, 2004. IMPORT OF MILK POWDER: The National Dairy Development Board placed orders for import of about 9460 MTs of milk powder under the tarrif rate quota. The need for the import arose due to acute shortage of milk resulting from drought conditions prevailing during the last three years in various states, delayed and poor calving of milch animals and shortage of feed and fodder. The total cost of imported powder was about Rs.78 crore on CIF basis. DROUGHT RELIEF: The country faced a severe drought last year. The centre allocated 87.36 lakh MTs of foodgrains free of cost and provided a cash assistance of Rs.4214.95 crore under the Calamity Relief Fund (CRF) and the National Calamity Contingency Fund (NCCF) to the drought affected States.

521,30-December-2003 15:4 IST,Ministry of Shipping,Shipping Sector sails full steam ahead,"YEAR END REVIEW 2003Shipping being a vital part of surface transport, a new Ministry of Shipping was created in November 2001 for a focused emphasis on development of shipping and ports. The present Government has brought out requisite amendments to the existing Acts to extend fiscal support to shipping and has sanctioned a number of projects in the shipping sector in the year 2003, thereby making vital contribution to the overall growth and development of the nation. Shipping sector activities cover various segments namely Shipping Lines, Ship Building, Inland Water Transportation and Port Sector. In all these areas, significant achievements have been made like augmentation of ports’ cargo handling capacity, acquiring of new vessels, entering into new joint ventures and new joint container services, building up of oil tankers and passenger vessels against inland and export orders and so on. The present Government has given top priority to enhancement of cargo handling capacity of major ports. The result is that whereas in the past, ships used to wait to berth at ports, today ‘ports wait for the ships’. Sagar Mala Project Announced As announced by the Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee on Independence Day 2003, the Government has decided to launch the ambitious Sagar Mala Project for rapid expansion and modernization of Shipping sector. Development of inland navigation would be an important part of this Project. The Project includes setting up of new ports, modernisation and expansion of existing ports, improvement in draft, productivity and efficiency of Indian Ports to benchmark them against international standards. The project envisages an investment of more than Rs.1,00,000 crore over a period of next 8 to 10 years, financed largely through public-private partnership with most of it coming from the private sector. To begin with, integrated development of Nhava Sheva and Kochi Ports would be taken up. Fiscal Support for Indian Shipping Amendments have been brought in the Income-Tax Act to bring relief to Indian Shipping. The Section 33AC of the Income Tax Act has been restored to the shipping business in order to allow appropriation of profits for creation of reserves. The limits up to which reserves can be built up by shipping and industries for new acquisitions will now include general reserves and share premium reserves. This will allow shipping companies to build up reserves for acquisition of new ships. The depreciation rates for ships have been enhanced from 20 to 25 per cent with effect from April 1, 2001. Ship building subsidy policy has been modified to include private sector shipyards and to increase the number of vessels covered. Ship building subsidy up to 30 per cent has been extended till August 2007 in both private and public sector shipyards. The procedure for import of ships has been liberalised All types of ships (including second hand ones) are now under Open General Licence (OGL) category and can be imported freely. Ship Acquisition and Licencing Committee (SALC) has since been abolished. Further, age norms have been done away with, except for the requirement of technical clearance for vessels above 25 years of age. Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) SCI has been rated an excellent performer under MoU rating for the 10th Year in a row and has declared 170 per cent interim dividend. Govt. has approved acquisition of two Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCC) by SCI in April this year. These are likely to be inducted in the fleet of SCI by 2004. Approval was also accorded to SCI to invest equity in a joint venture for construction of two Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) carrier vessels. Four aframax tankers of 1,10,000 DWT capacity and two 93,000 DWT crude oil tankers have been inducted into SCI’s fleet. HRD Initiatives As a major HRD initiative in the maritime sector, the Ministry of Shipping has established an Indian Institute of Maritime Studies (IIMS) at Mumbai. The four maritime training institutes functioning within the Government set up viz Marine Engineering and Research Institute, Kolkata, Marine Engineering and Research Institute, Mumbai, Training Ship Chanakya, Navi Mumbai and Lal Bahadur Shastri College of Advanced Maritime Studies and Research, Mumbai have come within the domain of IIMS. This new institute will actually be a forerunner to its ultimate conversion initially into a deemed University and subsequently to a full-fledged University. The new set up is expected to: (a) provide high quality of training to prepare top class trained personnel for the Merchant Navy, (b) make available better quality of manpower that in turn will be able to find even better avenues at higher levels of maritime employment allover the world, and (c) assist training institutes in the country to carry out research in a number of related fields. A concession of 50 per cent is being granted to women for undergoing pre-sea training. The Govt. has brought in liberalisation in recruitment of seafarers. Previously, the seamen used to be recruited through Seamen Employment Offices (SEO) run by the Government where trained seamen were registered. This regulatory activity is being withdrawn gradually and now a trained seaman possessing requisite qualification can be recruited directed by a shipping company without going through the SEOs. Inland Water Transport (IWT) The Government has announced a comprehensive new Inland Water Transport Policy to accelerate growth of Inland Water Transport Sector and encourage private sector investment and participation. Accordingly, necessary amendments were made in the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) Act, 1985 to authorize it to raise bonds in the open market. With effect from April 1, 2002 Inland Vessel Building Subsidy Scheme has been introduced that provides 30 per cent subsidy. Enhancing dredging capacity and the construction of permanent terminals on National Waterways 1 and 2 are in progress. The National Inland Navigational Institute, the first venture of its kind, has started functioning. The Technical Assistance Study for development of IWT has commenced, assisted by ADB. The funding pattern of Centrally Sponsored Scheme in IWT sector has been revised to give liberal assistance to States and a New Vessel Subsidy Scheme has been announced for inland vessels. Port Sector India has 12 major ports administered by the Central Government and 148 minor ports administrated by State Governments. The 12th major port (a modern energy port) at Ennore, north of Chennai, for handling coal and iron ore etc. was dedicated to the Nation by the Prime Minister in April, 2001. As a result of the ongoing thrust on development of additional capacity of the 12 major ports, the traffic handled by these ports has grown at a healthy rate. The ports of Mumbai, Mormugao, New Mangalore and Cochin have also attracted record number of tourists on cruise ships. For the first time, cargo handled in Major Ports, exceeded 281 million tonnes as against the total capacity of 291 million tonnes. Traffic was 313 million tonnes as against a capacity of around 363 million tonnes-indicating that the ports are waiting for the ships, not ships waiting to berth at ports, as was happening in the past. JNPT has become the 1st port in India to join the MILLION CLUB by handling more than one million TEUs and is ranked 29th in the container handling ports of the world. The ports of Mumbai, Mormugao, New Mangalore, Cochin and Tuticorin have been earmarked for development of Cruise Shipping. A Cruise Shipping Terminal has already been opened at Mumbai Port. Mechanised facilities for loading 20 million tonnes per annum of Coal has been made operational at Paradip Port at an investment of Rs.831.11 crore. Dredging Corporation of India, a PSU under the Ministry has been declared a Mini Ratna. Productivity Improvement in major ports During the last five years, traffic has increased from 252 million tonnes to 313 million tonnes whereas the manpower has reduced from 1,03,000 to 77,000 with significant improvement in overall productivity in major ports. The turn-around time of vessels has drastically reduced from 6.03 days to 3.67 days. Initiatives towards private sector participation 38 projects amounting to Rs.7640.78 crore for creating a port capacity of 123.52 million tonnes have been identified, of which 17 projects amounting to Rs.3246.95 crore for creating capacity of 61.53 million tonnes are already approved by the Government. The Government has also announced the Development of two Hub Ports of international standard, one each at Chennai and JNPT. Besides, 3 Container Terminals have been handed over to private operators. Major projects on the anvil Major projects on the anvil include, (i) conversion of bulk terminal into a container terminal at Jawaharlal Nehru Port, (ii) deepening of channel at Jawaharlal Nehru Port and (iii) developing the Vallarpadam International Container Transhipment Terminal with private participation. For reviving the Sethu Samundram Project, a detailed Environmental Impact Assessment is being undertaken by NEERI to reduce travel by about 400 nautical miles and 36 hours of ship time. With these encouraging developments, the year 2003 has been a landmark for the Indian shipping sector."
522,30-December-2003 15:8 IST,Ministry of Shipping,Road Transport and Highways - Highway development at an unprecedented scale,"YEAR END REVIEW 2003 The immense potential of road transport could not been tapped fully since Independence, largely due to lack of a good all-India road network. Today, however, our road infrastructure is poised for a major leap. Under the able leadership of Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the nation has embarked upon a massive road development programme that is one of the biggest in the world in the proposed time frame. National Highways Development Project (NHDP): The first giant step The NHDP is a major initiative towards qualitative and quantitative enhancement of National Highways, involving development and 4/6 laning of about 13,150 km of road at a cost of over Rs. 54,000 crore (at 1998-99 prices). The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is implementing NHDP. The programme set by the Prime Minister includes: The Golden Quadrilateral (GQ) or Phase-I of NHDP: Delhi-Kolkata-Chennai-Mumbai-Delhi circuit, involving 5846 km of road and costing over Rs. 25,050 crore. About 96 per cent of the Project is expected to be completed by December 2004. North-South & East-West Corridors or Phase-II of NHDP: From Srinagar to Kanayakumari and Silchar to Porbandar, involving a distance of 7,300 km and costing over Rs. 30,000 crore. The date of completion of this project, earlier given as December 2009 has now been advanced to December 2007. Other works include port connectivity to major ports: To maximize benefits, the major ports (Haldia, Paradip, Vishakhapatnam, Chennai, Tuticorin, Cochin, Mangalore, Mormugoa, Jawahar Lal Nehru Port and Kandla) are being connected to NHDP highways by about 400 km of roads. Other projects involve about 600 km of road development. No railway level crossing on NHDP: on the GQ alone, over 75 Railway Over Bridges are being constructed. The work on NHDP is proceeding as per plan and till November 30th 2003, out of the total GQ length of 5846 km, work has been completed on 2005 km and is under implementation on 3758 km. Work on the remaining 83 km will soon be awarded. Out of the total North-South and East-West Corridor length of 7,300 km, work has already been completed on 557 km and is under implementation on 423 km. The balance would be awarded in a phased manner so that the Project is completed by December 2007. NHDP’s prime focus is on developing international standard roads with enhanced safety features like (i)better riding surface, better road geometry, better traffic management and adequate signages, markings and safety barriers (ii) divided carriageways and service roads, (iii) grade separators, over bridges and underpasses for uninterrupted traffic flow, (iv) bypasses and (v) wayside amenities alongwith ambulances and cranes. Another striking feature of NHDP is that Indian firms have won a majority of Contracts. Out of 121 ongoing Contracts (as on Nov. 30, 2003) worth Rs. 17,916 crore, as many as 78 Contracts worth Rs.10,136 crore have gone to Indian firms, 32 Contracts worth Rs.5,940 crore to joint ventures while 11 Contracts worth Rs.1,840 crore have gone to foreign firms. 4-Laning of additional 10,000 km of National Highways: Second giant step Apart from the nearly 14,000 km of highways being developed under NHDP and other projects, the Government has announced 4-laning and development of another 10,000 km of National Highways stretches. These new stretches would be identified on the basis of traffic density, connectivity of State Capitals with NHDP (as announced by the Hon’ble Prime Minister on Independence Day 2003) and connectivity of important centres of tourist and economic importance with NHDP. The total cost of the projects under this is estimated at Rs.40,000 crore and work will be awarded in 4-5 years on Build, Operate and Transfer (BOT) basis. To ensure a reasonable return to the BOT operators, the Government will provide Grant for meeting the shortfall in the revenue on case to case basis. In fact, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has already identified seven National Highways stretches under this new initiative that will be taken up for 4-laning during the current financial year. These seven stretches cover a length of 622 km in five States and would be 4-laned at an approximate cost of Rs.2,500 crore. The stretches are : (i) 100 km. long Vadape-Gonde Section on NH-3 in Maharashtra, (ii) 118 km. long Pimpalgaon-Dhule Section on NH-3 in Maharashtra, (iii) 45 km. long Raipur-Aurang Section on NH-6 in Chattisgarh, (iv) 57 km. long Bharatpur-Mahua Section on NH-11 in Rajasthan, (v) 108 km. long Mahua-Jaipur Section on NH-11 in Rajasthan, (vi) 115 km. long Barhi-Ranchi Section on NH-33 in Jharkhand and (vii) 79 km. long Meerut-Muzaffarnagar Section on NH-58 in Uttar Pradesh. The details of the projects under which 16 State Capitals would be connected with NHDP highways involving 4-laning of a total length of 2933 km are given below. The remaining State Capitals are already covered under NHDP. National Highway Sections for State Capital connectivity with NHDP S. No. Connecting State/UT National Highway No. From (NHDP) To (CAPITAL) Length to be 4-laned (km) Arunachal Pradesh 31,52, 52A Guwahati (on E-W Corridor) Itanagar 345 Bihar 77 & 28 Muzaffarpur Patna 55 Chattisgarh 6 Nagpur Raipur 212 Goa 4A Belgaum Panaji 153 Haryana/Punjab 22 Ambala Chandigarh 58 Himachal Pradesh 22 Kalka Shimla 90 Jharkhand 33 Barhi Ranchi 115 Madhya Pradesh 12 Deori (Jn. with NH-26 on N-S Corridor) Bhopal 190 Manipur 53 Silchar (on E-W Corridor) Imphal 273 Mizoram 54 Silchar (on E-W Corridor) Aizwal 190 Meghalaya 40 Jorbat Shillong 62 Nagaland 36,39 Dobaka (on E-W Corridor) Kohima 205 Pondicherry (UT) 66 Chennai (via Tindivanam) Pondicherry 161 Sikkim 31A Sevok (on E-W Corridor) Gangtok 90 Tripura 44,53 Shilong Agartala 527 Uttaranchal 58,72 Delhi Dehradun 207 Highway development at unprecedented pace The tremendous thrust to road development under the present Government can be gauged from the fact that whereas in 50 years (1947-1997), only 556 km of national highways were 4-laned, but now in less than seven years, over 24,000 km would be 4-laned. Development of National Highways: Immense Benefits Employment generation: Direct employment to over three lakh workers (skilled and unskilled) per day. This figure will go up substantially once the work starts on more and more stretches. The indirect employment generation is several times more. Big boost to rural economy: Direct and faster access from hinterland to main market centres/metropolitan towns. Farm produce will have quicker access to the markets, thereby enhancing the reach and export potential of perishable goods, leading to better remuneration for the producer. Fillip to industry: A big jump start to Cement, Steel, Automobile, Road Construction and Tourism industries. An annual average consumption of 25 to 40 lakh metric tonne of cement and 2.5 to 3.0 lakh metric tonne of steel during 2001-04 has been estimated on just the GQ. In fact, the impact is already being felt. Better highways will reduce turn around time for goods carriers and facilitate introduction of more efficient multi-axle trucks. Commercial vehicles’ sales have grown 34.6 percent during April-Nov. 2003. Indian Construction companies will become capable of taking up road projects anywhere in the world. Faster and comfortable journeys will attract more and more domestic and international tourists. Massive national savings: According to a World Bank study, the completion of GQ alone will result in an annual saving of approximately Rs. 8,000 crore (at 1999 prices) on account of fuel savings, reduced wear and tear of vehicles and faster transportation etc. One can imagine the savings after the whole programme is completed. Encouraging Private Sector Participation For the first time in the country, the private sector has been involved in a big way in development and maintenance of National Highways. Comprehensive guidelines for private sector participation have been issued. Necessary legislative measures to facilitate private investment have been taken by amending the National Highways Act, 1956. Various tax and fiscal incentives have been provided for promoters to attract investments in the highways sector. Model Concession Agreements for projects costing more than Rs. 100 crore and also for smaller projects costing less than Rs. 100 crore have been finalized. Model Concession Agreement for annuity based projects is also in place. This is expected to bring uniformity in the various agreements for projects to be undertaken on BOT basis. Till date, 34 projects have been taken up by the private sector with a committed investment of about Rs. 6,000 crore and 18 such projects have already been completed. Incentives to Road Construction Industry: To encourage road construction industry in the country, the Central Government has offered many incentives, some of which are:- Total Custom Duty exemption on road building equipment not being produced in the country. Twenty-one such items have been identified.Income- Tax exemption for 10 years from NHDP earnings. In the Build, Operate and Transfer (BOT) projects, grant up to 40 per cent can be given. The NHAI Bonds have been exempted from Capital Gains. Central Road Fund revamped The present Government has taken a number of notable steps to arrange finances for the nation’s roads. In a historic decision, a nominal cess has been introduced on both petrol and diesel. The funds so collected are to be put aside in a non lapsable Central Road Fund (CRF) for the development of a modern road network. This has resulted in an allocation of Rs. 1192 crore, Rs. 5590 crore, Rs. 5962 crore, Rs. 5880 crore and Rs. 5791 crore from the revamped CRF during 1999-2000, 2000-01, 2001-02, 2002-03 and 2003-04 respectively as per details given below: (Rs. In crore) Year For National Highways For State Roads For Roads of Inter-State Connectivity & of Economic Importance For Rural Roads For Railways Total 1999-2000 1192 - - - - - 2000-2001 1800 985 5 2500 300 5590 2001-2002 2100 962 100 2500 300 5962 2002-2003 2000 980 100 2500 300 5880 2003-2004 1993 940 100 2325 433 5791 It is for the first time that such large funds are being mobilised for the development of not only National Highways, but also State roads and rural roads all over the country. Improvement of Riding Quality Programme At the end of 8th Plan, the total length of National Highways in the country was only 34298 km. Renewed focus on the road sector during the 9th Plan period has resulted in a length of 23,814 km being added to the National Highway network. The total length of National Highways as on date is 58112 km. The Government’s emphasis has been on improvement of riding quality of National Highways for the comfort of the road users. Improvement of Riding Quality Programme (IRQP) was initiated in 1999 to improve the riding quality of National Highways other then NHDP. Riding quality of about 33,000 km length has been improved from Plan and Non-Plan funds under IRQP. The balance length is targeted for improvement in next two years. The Control of National Highways (Land and Traffic) Act, 2003 A legislation on Control of National Highways (land and traffic) for prevention of encroachment, traffic regulation etc. on National Highways has been enacted. The salient features of the Act are as follows:- appointment of Highway Administration and its authorized officers for enforcing the provisions of the proposed legislation and establishment of Tribunal for hearing appeals against the orders of the Highway Administration and its authorized officers; prevention of unauthorized occupation of highway land and their removal; control of access points to the National Highways; regulation of different types of traffic permitted on the National Highways; control of use of road land for public utilities, drains, etc.; and issue of licenses or lease deeds for temporary use of the National Highways land. Exemption of payment of users’ fees by the Gallantry Awardees for use of National Highways and Bridges It has been decided that vehicles of Gallantry awardees, viz Param Vir Chakra, Ashok Chakra, Mahavir Chakra, Kirti Chakra, Vir Chakra and Shaurya Chakra will not have to pay users’ fees for use of tolled National Highways and bridges. Road Transport Initiatives In view of the large number of road accidents taking place in the country, a number of road safety measures have been initiated by the Government which encompass the educative aspect for generating road safety awareness on one hand and on the other, relate to a better enforcement as also to improvement in road conditions based upon various engineering based solutions. As a result, despite the increasing number of high performance motor vehicles coming on public roads and higher speeds on roads owing to improvement in road conditions, the number of accidents has come down from about 10 accidents per 1,000 vehicles in the year 1997 to about 7 by the year 2002. In the period 1997-98 to 2002-03, more than 37,000 drivers of heavy motor vehicles in the unorganized sector have been provided refresher training. A large number of NGOs have been associated by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways in the road safety programme. An expenditure of about Rs. 65 crore has been incurred in period from 1998-99 to 2002-03 on various road safety related activities. A number of measures have been taken to tighten emission norms and safety standards for motor vehicles: Bharat Stage-II norms, which are akin to Euro-II norms were introduced for the first time in the country in Delhi from April 1, 2000 in respect of light motor vehicle. These norms were extended to all categories of motor vehicles in the year 2001 to the four metros namely Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata. From April 1, 2003, these norms have come into force in Agra, Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Kanpur, Pune and Surat. The emission standards for agricultural tractors were notified on Sept. 8, 1999. The next generation norms for tractor have come into force from June 1, 2003. While in developed countries, the phasing out of lead was done over a period of more than 10 years, the same was done in just 6 years in our country. Next generation emission norms for two and three wheelers have also been notified and are to come into force from April 1, 2005. Through the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2001, transport vehicles running on CNG have been brought under the permit and fare purview of the State Governments. Emission and safety norms for vehicles operating on CNG as also on LPG have been notified which include testing, type approval and safety related aspects. An agreement to operate bus service between Kolkata and Dhaka was signed on June 17, 1999. Commercial operation of this bus service is taking place. An Agreement for bus service between Agartala and Dhaka was signed on July 10, 2001 and the service was inaugurated on Sept.19, 2003."

The objective of the scheme of constituting consumer clubs in schools is to educate children about the rights of consumers as provided in the Consumer Protection Act 2002 and to mobilise youngsters to spread consumer awareness among the common people in rural and urban areas. The Department of Consumer Affairs will provide a financial assistance of Rs. 10,000 per annum from the Consumer Welfare Fund for setting up consumer clubs in a middle/high/higher secondary schools. The new Consumer Protection Act-2002 which came into force on March 15, 2003 contains provisions for quicker disposal of consumer complaints, enhancing the capability of redressal agencies, strengthening them with more powers, streamlining procedures and widening the scope of the Act to make consumer courts more effective as well as to ensure faster execution of its own orders. Since inception, a total of 2165510 cases have been filed in consumer courts all over the country and 1805465 cases have been disposed of marking 83.37 per cent disposal. Bureau of Indian Standards has issued 16947 operative licenses as on June 30, 2003 covering more than 1100 different items ranging from food products and mineral water to electronics. BIS Quality System Certification Scheme based on International Standards of Quality Management has 916 operative licenses as on March 31, 2001. During 2002-03 more than 450 standards were formulated. Presently 17859 Indian Standards are in force covering important segments of the economy which help the industry in upgrading the quality of their goods and services. Under Gold Hallmarking Scheme of the Bureau to ensure purity of gold or its fineness, 14 hallmarking centres have been recognised for certification of gold and 650 jewellers have been certified. Measures were undertaken to expand futures trading in commodities by covering all commodities barring a few sensitive ones. At present futures trading is allowed in 54 commodities including wheat, rice gold and silver through 22 exchanges/associations. Three National Level exchanges have become operational and started trading in all approved commodities. Futures Trading has been extended to States like Kerala in the South and Jammu & Kashmir in the North. Online futures trading in wheat and rice was launched in December by the National Multi-Commodity Exchange of India Limited, Ahmedabad. Steps have been initiated to strengthen Forward Market Commission, the Regulatory Agency for futures trading in commodity. Offtake of foodgrains under all schemes including Targeted Public Distribution System and Antyodaya Anna Yojana (a scheme for providing highly subsidised foodgrains to the poorest of the poor) has shown substantial improvement during the year. The decision to export wheat from central pool was taken in November, 2000 and export of rice from December, 2000. India has now become a major exporter of foodgrains with an export of 67.93 lakh tonnes of wheat and 80.71 lakh tonnes of rice in 2002-2003 and 53.99 lakh tonnes of wheat and 29.28 lakh tonnes of rice during 2003-2004, upto November, 2003. The National Policy on Handling, Storage and Transportation of foodgrains, declared in June, 2000, inter alia, envisages creation of storage infrastructure with private sector participation. FCI is to guarantee utilisation of these facilities to the extent of 100 per cent for the first ten years and 75 per cent for the next ten years. Government has taken several steps to ensure speedy payment of sugarcane dues to the farmers. A buffer stock of 20 lakh tonnes of sugar was created for a period of one year in 2002-2003 involving a capital outgo of Rs. 786 crore. This involves Rs. 412 crore from the Sugar Development Fund (SDF) and Rs. 374 crore to be released by banks on account of stocks available with the sugar mills. This facility of maintaining a buffer stock of 20 lakh tonnes of sugar has been extended by one more year till December 17, 2004 so that the farmers will be able to receive the same amount as arrears from sugar mills as in the previous year. An assistance of Rs. 2563 crore was extended to State Governments to clear sugarcane price arrears during the year 2002-2003. Sugar factories are paid 75 per cent of buffer subsidy from the Sugar Development Fund payable for the entire period in advance. In addition to reimbursement of internal transport charges sugar mills are paid neutralisation of ocean freight disadvantage @ Rs. 350 per tonne on account of export shipments of sugar w.e.f. February 14, 2003. In order to promote sugar exports handling and marketing charges have been allowed @ Rs. 500 per tonne on export shipments of sugar w.e.f. October 3, 2003. The imports of edible oils have been liberalized with effect from 1st April, 1999 allowing import of all edible oils under OGL except coconut oil. With liberalization of import, edible oils are now being imported in substantial quantities. About 42.66 lakh tonnes of edible oil has been imported during the year 2002-2003."

526,30-December-2003 17:29 IST,Ministry of Environment and Forests,Forest cover in the country goes up to 20.55% MoEF TO BRING BIG URBAN PROJECTS UNDER PURVIEW OF ENVIRONMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT TECHNOLOGY BAZAAR GENERATES BUSINESS WORTH $325 millions MoEF DRAWS UP PLANS TO TACKLE EFFECTS OF FLOWERING OF MULI BAMBOO,"Year-end Review: 2003It was a momentous year for the Ministry of Environment & Forests as significant initiatives were taken and rapid strides were made in protecting environment and conserving the country’s bio-diversity. Various steps were taken to prevent and control pollution. People’s participation became the ‘mantra’ of the Ministry. Greener India All round efforts to make the country greener bore fruit as the latest State of Forest Report (2001) released this year revealed that the forest cover in the country had increased from 19.39% in 1999 to 20.55% in 2001. Forest Cover here includes all lands more than 1 ha. Area having tree canopy density of 10 per cent and above. The dense forest cover increased from 377358 sq.km. in 1999 to 416809 sq.km. in 2001.Assessment of tree cover has been made for the first time in 2001 State of Forest Report. The total tree cover in the country (notional area with 70% canopy density) has been reported as 81472 sq.km. or about 2.48 per cent of the country’s geographical area.The total forest cover of 675538 sq.km. together with tree outside forest of 81472 sq.km. constitute 757010 sq.km. of forest and tree cover which is 23.03% of the geographical area of the country. For the first time, forest cover mapping of the entire country was done at 1:50,000 scale by digital method (previously done visually at 1:250,000 scale). People and Forests The Joint Forest Management Programme was given further momentum so as to catapult this as a people’s movement. JFM Committees have been accorded the necessary legal back-up besides extending this concept to dense forest areas. The Joint Forest Management (JFM), which provides for sharing of benefits of the forest conservation with the local communities has increased from 7 million hectares in 1998 to 16 million hectares in 2003. All the 1,70,000 forest villages in and around 32 million hectares of degraded forest in the country will be brought under JFM by the year 2007. Big Urban Projects and Environment Concerned by the seriousness of continuing pollution of rivers and other water bodies, the Ministry decided to bring new projects relating to construction of new townships, industrial townships, settlement colonies, commercial complexes, hotel complexes, hospitals, office complexes for 1000 persons or above or discharging sewage of 50, 000 litres per day and above or with an investment of Rs. 50 crores and above and new industrial estates having an area of 50 hectares and above under the purview of Environment Impact Assessment (EIA). Industrial estates having high pollution potential will also be brought under EIA irrespective of area. A draft notification to this effect was issued by the MoEF in pursuance of a directive of the Supreme Court to “amend the Rules under the Environment (Protection) Act so as to require the environment impact assessment for the purposes of the town planning Acts”. Vision Statement on Environmental Health For the first time in the history of the country, the Ministry of Environment and Forests came out with a comprehensive Vision Statement on Environmental Health which takes into account the adverse effects of growing hazardous and bio-medical wastes, radiation and climate change on human health. The Statement also deals with strategies and action plans required at various levels to ensure health for all. One of the main features of the statement is that it takes into consideration the unique problems relating to environmental health in various areas of the country. It has recommended focused Health Risk Studies, which bring out the cause-effect relationship in clear terms for the benefit of policy makers. Participatory Approach The Charter on Corporate Responsibility for Environmental Protection, the culmination of four-month long discussions among the Central and State Governments, pollution control boards and 17 categories of major polluting industries resulted in the voluntary commitment of the industry to go beyond the existing pollution control norms to significantly improve the environment. Sugar industry, pharmaceuticals, distilleries, tanneries, pesticide units, cement industry, fertiliser industry, dyes and dye intermediates, pulp and paper, thermal power plants, petrochemical units, caustic soda industry, oil refineries, aluminium plants, iron and steel sector, copper and zinc industry have come forward to take necessary technological initiatives for modernisation and upgradation of production and processing activities to radically bring down the pollution load in a time bound manner. The Charter was released in March, 2003. The Kanyakumari Charter on Conservation and Management of Marine Biodiversity emphasised that biodiversity could be protected without prejudice to livelihood security and long-term developmental needs of the nation through scientific study of the available resources, carrying capacity and sustainable alternatives. The Charter released in March, 2003 while making several recommendations underscored that all stakeholders should be taken into confidence while taking up conservation measures and the socio-economic and ethnic aspects besides awareness generation shall be built into all conservation projects. Conservation Project Tiger has been extended to 27 reserves in 17 States, encompassing 37761 sq. km. of tiger habitat, with the addition of four new tiger reserves viz. Pakui – Nameri (Arunachal/Assam), Bori – Satpura (MP), Bhadra (Karnataka) and Pench (Maharashtra). Project Tiger has been rated as a role model and one of the 56 events that changed India since Independence. The tiger population in the country has registered an increase from 1827 in 1972 to 3642 in 2001- 02. For the first time, information and communication technology was used for linking important tiger reserves in the GIS Domain for evolving a management support system including crime detection, dissemination of information through web and evolving a ‘National Tiger Monitoring and Habitat Evaluation System’ with regional protocols. With a view to complement and strengthen the national efforts in conservation of wild life, planned breeding programme for Red Panda and Lion Tailed Macaque has been taken up by Central Zoo Authority. As part of this programme, captive bred Red Panda from Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park, Darjeeling were released in the wild. Rallying Global Action India has emerged as a major player in the global action for environmental protection. After successfully hosting the 8th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP-8) in New Delhi during October-November, 2002, the Ministry organized a Technology Bazaar and related conferences in the national capital from November 10-13, 2003. This Bazaar showcased the state of the art technologies in various field including renewable’s, energy from waste, resource conservation, energy efficiency etc. This event enabled several developed countries viz. West European, Japan, USA, Canada and their companies to negotiate CDM projects for Green House Gases (GHG) reduction and sustainable development. The Bazaar provided an opportunity to several of our companies to demonstrate their technologies and offered networking opportunities with the delegates/entrepreneurs from various countries. The Bazaar generated business deals worth over $325 millions. Meeting the Emerging Challenges In a significant move the Minister of Environment and Forests has accorded conditional clearance to the commercial introduction into the country of Bt cotton after rigorous field trials and evaluation. While setting up an elaborate institutional mechanism for monitoring the introduction of genetically modified organisms into the country, the Government has ratified the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety which seeks to regulate the transboundary movement of living modified organisms. Vehicular Pollution Control Efforts to control vehicular pollution yielded results especially in the National Capital Region of Delhi. Now twenty-four highly polluted areas have been identified in the country for concerted efforts for pollution control. Action Plans have been prepared and are being implemented in these areas. The National Air Quality Monitoring Programme has been expanded to comprise 290 stations covering 90 cities and towns in 24 States and five Union Territories in the country. Minimum National Standards (MINUS) for 70 categories of polluting industries have been evolved. A special scheme for preparation of Zoning Atlas has been launched under the Environment Management Capacity Building Programme with World Bank assistance. This is to help in siting of industries, industrial estate planning etc. This exercise has been completed for 60 districts and work is in progress for 61 more districts in 18 States and one Union Territory. National River Conservation Plan The National River Conservation Directorate has achieved several milestones since its emergence as national body for conservation of water resources in the country and cleaning of rivers and lakes. Presently, 157 towns in 18 States and 31 polluted river stretches have been covered under NRCP. It involves a total cost of Rs.4064 crore with Government of India share of Rs.3464 crores. Under NRCP the schemes implemented in the States includes Interception and Diversion of Sewage, Construction of Sewage Treatment Plants, Low Cost Sanitation, Crematoria, Afforestation and River Front Development etc. 763 projects with a value of Rs.2460 crore have been sanctioned under NRCP. This is in addition to 261 projects sanctioned under Ganga Action Plan Phase-I. Significant success has been achieved in controlling industrial pollution in rivers and lakes in the country. In 1997, 851 defaulting industries were identified which were generating BOD load of 100Kg/day or more and discharging their effluents without proper treatment directly or indirectly into the water course. These industries were directed to install their respective Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs). While 608 industries have installed ETPs, 238 industries have been closed down. National Lake Conservation Plan The scope of the National Lake Conservation Plan (NLCP) has been increased to 16 lakes. The 6 latest projects have been approved with an outlay of Rs.57.71 crores. Awareness and Education The scope and reach of the programme, National Green Corps, launched in 2001-2002 to spread environmental awareness among school children, was expanded. Under this programme, the major thrust is on dissemination of knowledge through activity-oriented programmes. Eco Clubs are to be established in 150 schools in each district of the country. So far, more than 52,000 clubs have been established. The programme is expected to cover one lakh schools during the Tenth Plan. A weekly television programme called Bhoomi was launched on Doordarshan National Channel during 2002-03. The programme has received wide appreciation from viewers and environmental NGOs. To encourage film/documentary producers to choose environment related subjects for their films and to bestow recognition on meritorious among them, Ministry decided to support a National Film Festival on Environment & Wildlife called Vatavaran. Plans for a Future Problem As we come close to the end of the year, the Ministry is busy in giving final touches to the plan of action on how to tackle the impending flowering of Muli Bamboo in several North-Eastern states especially Mizoram. It decided to approach the Government for removing restrictions on the export of Muli Bamboos at the earliest. It also decided to set up a task force which will look into the possible explosion in population of rodents which is associated with gregarious flowering of bamboos and suggest measures to control them so that they do not form a part of the chain of events leading to famine, as has happened in the past. Large scale extraction of Muli Bamboos have to be carried out before the flowering takes place and regeneration of mixed vegetative growth will be required to keep such problems in future under control. Every possible use of the extracted bamboos have to be explored so that the local communities get the benefit of it. It is estimated that about 26 million tones of Muli Bamboos will be affected out of which 10 million are in accessible areas and the rest 16 million in inaccessible areas about which nothing can be done. It was decided that the bamboos extracted from the accessible areas will be sold in open auction on a day to day basis."

530,30-December-2003 18:0 IST,Ministry of Home Affairs,Strenthening measures for maintaining internal security in the country and tackling insurgency PROBLEM IN THE NORTH-EAST WAS ON THE HIGH AGENDA OF THE GOVERNMENT DURING THE YEAR,"YEAR-END REVIEWInternal Security: Every possible effort was made during the year to strengthen measures for maintaining internal security and law and order in the country. Considering the problem of cross-border terrorism in Jammu & Kashmir, special efforts were made to check infiltration of militants from across the border. As a major success Shah Nawaz Khan alias Ghazi-baba, the mastermind behind the December 13th attack on Indian Parliament and also on the Jammu & Kashmir Assembly was killed by the Border Security Force in an encounter in Central Srinagar on October 30, 2003. The Pakistan Based Terrorist leader of Jaish-e-Mohammad was killed along with his accomplice. The implementation of the Economic Package announced by the Prime Minister, the year before also generated healing touch to the people of Kashmir. The State Government with the back-up from the Centre launched several people’s friendly programmes for employment generation and developing the tourism industry. The Inter-State Council meeting at Srinagar in August, 2003 (such a meeting held for the first time outside Delhi) and addressed by the Prime Minister, Shri Atal Bihar Vajpayee, the Dy. Prime Minister, Shri L.K. Advani and participated by several Union Ministers and State Chief Ministers was an important step to instill confidence in the people. The conduct of the meeting and participation of various agencies reflected the near normalcy position in the troubled State of Jammu & Kashmir. This 8th meeting of the council also rounded up the discussion on the Sarkaria Commission Recommendations. The way is now clear for the Council to take up other important issues. The Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA) was further amended by an Enactment of Parliament for providing Review Committees both at the Centre and the States for fully safeguarding against its possible misuse. On the naxalite problem in States like Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Maharastra, West Bengal and some portions of Uttar Pradesh, the High Power Centre headed by the Union Home Secretary held several meetings in places like Hyderabad and Bhubneshwar. In its last meeting at Bhubneshwar an important decision was taken to deploy the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) on a permanent basis in States where the naxalite problem is of greater concern. The CRPF Battalions being deployed in such areas will be specially trained keeping in view the area specific concern. Police Reforms: After considering the request from several States to raise the Centre’s share of funds for Police modernisation, it was decided to divide the States in three categories A, B, C and accordingly the Centre’s Share was raised to 75% for ""A"" Category, 60% for ""B"" Category and 50% for ""C"" Category. The funds for modernization has already been raised from Rs.200 crores to Rs.1000 crores annually. North-East Insurgency: Government of India, the State Government of Assam and the Bodo Liberation Tigers reached a Memorandum of Settlement for the creation of an autonomous self-governing body to be known as Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) within the State of Assam. The settlement not only ushered in bright hopes for the Bodo people but over 2500 Bodo Militants surrendered with their arms and ammunition on December 6, 2003 at Kokhrajhar (Assam) following a follow-up Agreement on the Constitution of the BTC with 46 Members having substantive power for Legislation and Local Governance. The Dy. Prime Minister and Home Minister, Shri L.K. Advani attended a special function on the occasion and addressed the surrendered militants. They are being rehabilitated suitably. On the external front India finally scored a point when the Royal Bhutan Army launched a major operation against the ULFA, NDFB and the Kamtapur Liberation Organization (KLO) to flush out these militant cadres from its soil. These groups had long since set up training camps inside the Bhutanese territory and carrying out insurgency in India. The RBA almost demolished all the 30 camps of these Indian insurgent groups with a heavy hand during the fortnight long operation launched in the middle of December, 2003. This major action was in keeping with India’s continuous demand to flush out these insurgents from the Bhutanese soil. Multi-Purpose National Identity Cards: The Government during the year launched a pilot project for issuing Multi-Purpose National Identity Cards to citizens. The project was launched in a few selected sub-districts in various districts of 13 States namely Jammu & Kashmir, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttaranchal, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Tripura, Goa, Tamil Nadu, Pondicherry and Delhi. The pilot project initiated in April 2003 is likely to be completed in a year’s time covering approximately a population of 29 lakhs. Then onwards the MNIC project will be taken up on a country-wide basis for the entire population. This will also facilitate preparation of a National Register of Citizens. The Centre has also asked the states to launch a special drive for detecting and deporting foreign nationals over staying in India. Extradtion of Criminals: India signed extradition treaties and agreements for mutual legal assistance with a number of countries to facilitate deportation of criminals who generally take shelter in those countries after committing heinous crimes here. The Union Home Ministry also organized a very important International Conference on Fugitives with the purpose of evolving a well coordinated mechanism for extradition of these fugitives.

532,31-December-2003 12:31 IST,Ministry of Railways,Railways to use new device to minimise level crossing accidents,"Indian Railways is in the process of installing Train Actuated Warning Device (TAWD) at selected level crossings spread across the country to give audio-visual warning to road users about an approaching train. To begin with, 100 such devices are to be installed. Field trials to prove its reliability, fail-safe features and suitability have been carried out. Decision on further installation of the device at more level crossings will be taken after reviewing performance. During the last five years, 490 unmanned level crossings have been manned and funds for manning 2145 crossings already sanctioned. The policy of manning unmanned level crossings is under review and Indian Railways require approximately Rs.2450 crores to man its 21,792 unmanned level crossings. Anti Collision Device(ACD), satellite based technology developed by the Konkan Railway Corporation to prevent collision between trains, will provide additional safety shield at manned and unmanned level crossings through an audio-visual indication to road users. Provision of ACD and survey for provision of the device on different sections of Indian Railways is in progress. The overall cost of providing ACD on the entire railway network comes to Rs.1600 crores."

536,31-December-2003 14:40 IST,Ministry of Commerce & Industry,India emerges key player in WTO,"The year 2003 witnessed the emergence of India as a key player in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) at the Cancun Ministerial Conference. Shri Arun Jaitley, Union Minister of Commerce & Industry, who led the Indian delegation at the Ministerial Conference in September 2003 described Cancun as a historical turn in the WTO and summed it up thus: “Our achievement in Cancun is that India and the developing countries have left their imprint on the WTO Agenda. We set the agenda at Cancun. The agenda was two-pronged: First, our strong demand for end to subsidies that rich countries provide to their farmers, which in turn, hurt our farmers; and Two, our objections to areas such as foreign investment. We had built strong alliances of the developing countries – G-22 on agriculture and G-16 on the Singapore issues….. Unlike in the past, the developed nations could not break our alliances. Third, this time our stand was not negative…. We did not always say no. We proactively engaged in the negotiations.” Emergence of the coalition of countries on agriculture in the WTO (G-20) representing the needs of millions of farmers in all the major less developed regions of the world in Asia, the Americas and in Africa, was another major development during the year. As a founder member, India accords the highest priority to the Group which will continue to work for significant reduction in trade distortions, more meaningful market access and a better deal for farmers in all developing countries. Shri Jaitley, who also attended the first post-Cancun meeting of the Group in Brasilia (Brazil), has indicated that India will continue to play its role in supporting and strengthening the Group from within. The year also saw India’s export crossing the US $ 50 billion mark. India’s exports of merchandise goods during 2002-03 crossed the crucial milestone of US $ 50 billion, by reaching a figure of US $ 51.7 billion. The export growth achieved during the year was 18.05%, exceeding the target of 12% fixed for 2002-03. With this achievement, India was able to more than double its exports of merchandise goods in dollar terms in a span of 10 years. In 1993-94, India’s exports were valued at US $ 22.2 billion. In rupee terms, the export of merchandise goods during 2002-03 was valued at Rs. 2,50,130 crore compared to Rs. 2,09,018 crore in 2001-02 with a growth rate of 19.67%. The growth rate of 18% achieved by India was next only to that of China at 22% and was the second highest among the 30 leading exporters in world merchandise trade in 2002. Significantly, with this, India’s share in world exports in merchandise goods increased from 0.4% in 1992-93 and 0.7% in 2001-02 to 0.8% in 2002-03. Export growth momentum in 2003 was sustained despite strengthening of the rupee vis-à-vis the US dollar and other adverse factors. On the bilateral front, the year witnessed a record increase in exports to China with a growth of almost 106% in US dollar terms in 2002-03. Exports to USA also showed a substantial increase of over 27% with exports crossing the US $ 1 billion mark during 2002-03. It is significant that export growth was registered during the year across all regions. Exports to Latin America went up by 34% while exports to Asia and Oceania region grew by 42.85%. Among the neighbouring countries, India’s exports to Pakistan grew by 42.92% during 2002-03; exports to Sri Lanka by 45%, to Nepal by 38% and to Bangladesh by 9%. Among the territorial initiatives, “Focus: CIS” programme, announced on 31 March, 2003 by Shri Jaitley at the time of announcement of the Exim Policy for the year 2003-04 is under way and aims to focus on trade with countries of the CIS with emphasis in the first phase on seven countries viz., Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan and Ukraine. The “Focus: Africa” programme was extended with effect from 1st April, 2003 to all countries of sub-Saharan Africa where India has Missions along with six countries of the North Africa region. The total number of countries thus covered under “Focus: Africa” increased from initial seven countries to 24 countries of the African continent. As many as 48 Agri Export Zones (AEZs) for different products have been set up in 19 States and the total anticipated value of exports from these AEZs in the next 5 year would be Rs. 10,299 crore. The state-wise break-up of approved AEZs include West Bengal (5), Karnataka (3), Uttaranchal (4), Punjab (3), Uttar Pradesh (4), Maharashtra (6), Andhra Pradesh (4), Jammu & Kashmir (2), Tripura (1), Madhya Pradesh (3), Tamil Nadu (3), Bihar (1), Gujarat (2), Sikkim (2), Himachal Pradesh (1), Orissa (1), Jharkand (1), Kerala (1) and Assam (1). Approvals have been given for setting up of 23 Special Economic Zones (SEZs) in the country and a number of measures were taken during the year for promoting SEZs. Exports from SEZs have been growing steadily. During the first 6 months of the current financial year 2003-04, exports from SEZs amounted to Rs. 6,008.46 crore compared to Rs. 4889.85 crore during the corresponding period of last year representing a growth of 23%. Movement towards free trade agreements received a major impetus with the signing of a Framework Agreement for establishing a Free Trade Area (FTA) between India and Thailand (on 9 October, 2003). A Framework Agreement for Comprehensive Economic Cooperation were also signed between India and ASEAN in the Second ASEAN-India Summit at Bali in Indonesia during October, 2003. The Framework Agreements include provisions relating to FTA in goods, services and investments and are aimed at strengthening India’s trade and economic cooperation with its Southeast Asian neighbours, consistent with the country’s Look East Policy."
537,31-December-2003 14:41 IST,Ministry of Commerce & Industry,Clarification on Patents (Amendment) Bill 2003,"Reacting to the report in a section of the press regarding the Patents (Amendment) Bill 2003 “kills opposition to patent application; and Patent application can be opposed on 2 grounds”, the Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion, Ministry of Commerce & Industry, have said that the reports are not only factually deficient and misleading but also based on incomplete understanding of the patent system and the Patents (Amendment) Bill, 2003 which was recently introduced during the Winter Session of Parliament. The factual position in respect of opposition procedures under the patent law is as below: <U+F0B7> The Bill does not do away with opposition procedures; instead it seeks to introduce a revised and tiered mechanism for representation against patent applications as well as for opposition and revocation of patents. <U+F0B7> The proposed restructuring/revision basically aims at introducing simplified, efficient, cost-effective and user-friendly mechanisms which not only facilitate expeditious grant of patents but also safeguard the interest of third parties. <U+F0B7> The proposed restructuring/revision is also in line with the Bill’s objective of revising the time lines for processing of patent applications. The time taken for processing and grant of patents has been a matter of concern and subject of criticism. Analysis has indicated that delays are also substantially due to statutory provisions which prescribe lengthy time lines for each stage/level of processing. The Bill therefore seeks to fully rationalise/ restructure all time lines with a view to progressively reduce the time for each activity and bring patent office operations in line with international standards. <U+F0B7> In respect of existing provisions relating to opposition, it has been noted that a notice of opposition, when filed, becomes a quasi-judicial proceeding and holds up the processing of patent application till the proceedings are finalised. Theoretically, therefore, if an opposition proceedings continues indefinitely the patent application also remains unresolved indefinitely. Further, statistics reveal that not more than 3 per cent of all patent applications accepted (and less than 0.5% of all applications filed) are opposed at any given point of time. On the other hand, all accepted and published applications have to wait for a statutory period of at least 5 months before being processed further. The Bill seeks to provide correctives against such avoidable delays. <U+F0B7> The restructured/revised procedures proposed in the Bill provide the following opportunities for representation against patent applications by third party and for opposition and revocation of patents: <U+F0FC> In the first instance any person may represent under Section 25(1) (a) and (b) against the processing/grant of a patent application on substantial grounds of patentability namely novelty, inventiveness and industrial applicability. The challenge can also be made on grounds of non-disclosure or wrong disclosure of source of geographical origin of biological material and anticipation by traditional knowledge available in India or elsewhere. <U+F0FC> Further all the grounds on which patents can be opposed have also been retained as the grounds of revocation of patent under Section 25 (3) whereby any person can approach the Controller within one year. The decision of the Controller under Section 25 is also appealable under Section 117 (A) i.e. clause 55 of the Bill. <U+F0FC> A third opportunity is also available to any person to oppose and seek revocation of a patent any time during the term of a patent. This opportunity is available under Section 64 and can be availed before the Intellectual Property Appellate Board or High Court. <U+F0B7> In view of the above it would be obvious that the Bill neither seeks to dispense with the opposition opportunities nor restrict the basis for the same. In fact the proposed amendments are in tune with the Government’s intention to revamp intellectual property administration through simplification and rationalisation of procedures so as to make them user-friendly and comparable to international standards/ practices."

542,31-December-2003 14:51 IST,Ministry of Information & Broadcasting,Electronic media no way hamper growth of print media newspapers circulation up by 24 per cent – RNI Report,"The 47th ‘Press In India’ Report reveals that the total circulation figure of newspapers jumped up from 11,52,53,948 copies in 2001 to 14,20,05,543 copies in 2002-03, registering an increase of more than 24 per cent. The increase can be attributed to the larger number of publishers submitting Annual Statements. During 2002-03 newspapers in Uttar Pradesh had a total circulation of 2,80,46,287 copies followed by Delhi with 2,18,56,174 copies. On 31st March 2003 the total figure for registered newspapers stood at 55,780, an increase of 7.35 per cent over the previous year. The Report, the first on a financial year basis, was presented by Shri G.D.Beliya, Registrar, Newspapers of India to Shri Pawan Chopra, Secretary, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting here today. The Report indicates that among multi-edition Dailies, Dainik Bhaskar publishing in Hindi with 18 editions, had the largest claimed circulation of 17, 17,294 copies, followed by Times of India with 13,94,646 copies. For single-edition Dailies, Hindustan Times an English Daily claimed a circulation of 11,12,160 copies, while the Hindu came second with a figure of 9,22,407 copies.

Out of the 7156 newspapers who sent their Annual Statements in 2002-03, 5371 were owned by individuals while 950 were owned by Joint Stock Companies. Language-wise, Hindi dominated with 3410 newspapers, followed by English with 750. In circulation too, Hindi maintained its lead with 6,17,68,735 copies while English followed with 2,6213,142 copies.

The SSA has takenoff with a flying start. The Centre approved all the state plans at a faster pace to facilitate them to implement the programme. Rupees 9500 crores have been provided for SSA and District Primary Education Programme during the current financial year. A strong monitoring system has been put in place so that the programme is implemented by all the states on a time bound basis. The HRD Minister has taken personal interest in the implementation of SSA. He himself held a number of review meetings in Delhi and state capitals and has been impressing upon Chief Ministers of those states which have lagged behind in the implementation of the programme. The National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) took a number of initiatives to bridge the gap between the teacher availability and the requirement in view of the massive expansion of education at the elementary level. It has allowed State Governments to increase the intake in their District Institutes of Educational Training (DIET) from 200 to 500 seats per year . It has agreed to accord recognition for new Basic Teacher Certificate (BTC) courses for elementary school teachers in B.Ed. institutions. The Council also proposes to allow State Governments to offer special courses to B.Ed. candidates for enabling them to tech at elementary level. The Planning Commission has estimated a requirement of around 11.5 lakh additional trained teachers in the country to attain the objective of universalisation of elementary education by 2010. A special programme ‘Accelerated Female Literacy Programme (AFLP) has been launched in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh to give a boost to female literacy in the backward regions. Special awards have also been instituted for commendable work undertaken in regions of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh where female literacy rate was poor as per the 2001 census. A pilot project has been initiated for expansion of secondary education in un-served areas. This pilot project has begun in Balia (U.P.). In the long run it would become a model for central support for secondary schools in other backward areas of the country, with funds being made available under the 10th Plan. During the year, a new programme, the National Programme for Education of Girls at Elementary Level (NPEGEL) was also implemented in 21 states. Forty five new Kendriya Vidyalayas are being opened in the current fiscal year in various states and union territories to cater to the rising demand.

548,31-December-2003 16:57 IST,Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers,Chemicals & Fertilizers - Year-End-Review-2003,"Year-End-Review-2003OMIFCO Fertilizer Plant The Foundation Stone for the Oman Indian Fertilizer Company (OMIFCO)’s fertilizer plant at Sur in Oman has been be laid by the Union Minister for Chemicals & Fertilizers on Oct.1, 2003. OMIFCO is a joint venture fertilizer company promoted by IFFCO & KRIBHCO from Indian side and Oman Oil Company from Oman, at a total cost of US $ 969 million, with equity contribution of US $ 80 million each by IFFCO and KRIBHCO and US $ 160 million by Oman Oil Company. The plant will produce 16.52 lakh tonnes of urea and 2.48 lakh tonnes of ammonia per annum on completion in July, 2005. Government of India has signed a contract to procure urea from OMIFCO for a 15 year period, at a fixed long term price. Similarly IFFCO, one of the Indian sponsors, has signed an agreement to procure surplus ammonia from OMIFCO for 10 year period at a fixed long term price. OMIFCO is a mega industrial project being undertaken by the Indian Fertilizer Industry with support from the Governments of Indian and Oman and is a shining example of Indian entrepreneurship and economic cooperation with other countries. The OMIFCO Project would be a test case for future ventures by Indian Fertilizer Industry outside the country. New Fertilizer Pricing Policy A new pricing policy for the urea industry in the shape of Group Concession Scheme is introduced. The new pricing policy brings about greater transparency, uniformity and efficiency in subsidy disbursements to urea units and induces urea manufacturers to take cost reduction measures on their own and be competitive. The policy of the Government has been aimed not only to achieve maximum possible degree of self-sufficiency in production ofNitrogenous and Phosphatic fertilizers but also to ensure affordability to farmers by fixing uniform selling prices, to be applicable through out the country. Self sufficiency in Urea and DAP India has achieved self-sufficiency in production capacity of urea. In case of DAP and complexes, their installed capacity has bypassed the current level of domestic requirement. However, to meet the requirement of potash, the country will continue to depend entirely on import in the absence of its own reserves. India has today become the third largest producer in the world by producing about 146 lakh MT and N&P in nutrient terms. There has been a significant increase in consumption of fertilizers compared to last year. The sales of urea and DAP have been 93.1 lakh MT and 22.1 lakh MT respectively, a growth rate of 4 per cent in urea and a decline of about 4 per cent in DAP sales compared to last year. The supply situation is comfortable throughout the country. Even the procurement and marketing of DAP and other forms of complex fertilizers is totally decontrolled. A Control Room monitors the movement, dispatches and arrivals of stock in different parts of the country. Decontrol of Urea A beginning has been made in the realm of decontrol and liberalization by restricting allocation of Urea under the essential commodities Act to 75 per cent of the reassessed capacity of each unit in Kharif 2003 and 50 per cent of the capacity in Rabi 2003-04. The Urea units will be free to sell the remaining Urea at the designated maximum Retail Price (MRP). During Stage-II commencing from April 1st, 2004, urea distribution will be totally decontrolled after evaluation of the performance in Stage – I. Guidelines for implementation of the concession Scheme for decontrolled phosphatic and potassic (P&K) Fertilizers have been revised. The revised guidelines lay stress on timely certification of sales; restricting eligibility for concession on SSP units that undergo the mandatory inspection by Technical Audit and Inspection Cell and use grades of rock phosphate notified by the Department of Fertilizers. Closure of loss making units The entire Fertilizer Corporation of India Ltd. (FCI) and Hindustan fertilizer Corporation Ltd. (HFC), excepting its Jodhpur Mining Organisation have been closed as they were running in losses. Pharma Industry Indian drugmarkers ruled on the global pharmaceutical map in 2003 as their low-cost medicines made HIV/AIDS treatment accessible to a million poor in sub-sahran Africa and Asia. The Indian Pharmaceutical Industry today leads India’s knowledge based industries with wide ranging capabilities in the complex field of drug discovery, manufacture and technology. It hold a leadership position in the world in terms of technology, quality and range of medicines manufactured. From simple drugs like Anacin sophisticated antibiotics and complex biotechnology derived products, India now produces almost every type of medicine. India produces not only pharmaceutical formulations but also over 500 active pharmaceutical ingredients are manufactured from basic stage. Ancillary industry is also fully developed and a complete range of pharmaceutical manufacturing equipment is locally produced. Re-Structuring of sick PSU The Government spends annually approximately Rs. 300 crore as non-plan assistance on four sick fertilizer companies viz. HFC, FCI, PDIL and PPCL, which have accumulated losses of more than Rs. 15,000 crore as on March 31, 2002. Considering this, the Government is pursuing closure of non-viable units and revival of viable units through comprehensive restructuring proposals based on unit-wise techno-economic viability with regard to these companies. Accordingly the Government took the decision to close down the entire Fertilizer Corporation of India Ltd. (FCI) and Hindustan fertilizer Corporation Ltd. (HFC), excepting its Jodhpur Mining Organisation, as the two public sector undertakings have been making losses since inception and their accumulated losses as on March 31 this year were Rs.7921 crore and Rs.6726 crore respectively. The decision to close down the two undertakings will not impact the prices or availability of Urea as none of the units of FCI and HFC were in operation and the Haldia Fertilizer Project of HFC though mechanically completed in 1979 could never be commissioned. The country is almost self sufficient in Urea and its total availability in 2001-2002 was 21.6 million MT and consumption only 19.9 million MT. In addition, from 2005 – 2006 onwards, 1,652 Million MT of urea would be available from the Oman – India Fertilizer Company (OMIFCO). Also, the Government is considering expanding KRIBHCO at Hazira and the RCF at Thal. Pharmaceutical Policy – 2002 New Pharmaceutical Policy, 2002 being implemented with objective to ensure abundant availability of quality medicines at affordable price. The Policy also aims at promoting R&D, strengthening indigenous capability for manufacture of quality medicines & encouraging new investments with a view to prepare the domestic industry to meet the challenges of post 2005 scenario. The span of drug price control under the Drug Price Control Order would also get reduced considerably. Extension center of Central Institute of Plastic Engineering & Technology (CIPET) Central Institute of Plastic Engineering & Technology, an autonomous body under the administrative control of the Department of Chemicals & Petrochemicals, has set up extension center at Guwahati in Assam; Haldia in West Bengal & Patna in Bihar. These centers provide trained manpower for the Plastic Procession Industries in the Eastern & North-Eastern Region. Plastic Processing Industry Plastic Processing Industry is removed. Considering the necessity of modernization and upgradation of technology in this sector, a new scheme of Plastic Technology Upgradation Fund (PTUFs) would be launched. Mega Chemical Industrial Estate Apart from improving basic infrastructure like power, communication, transportation etc. The Task Force on Petrochemicals and recommended setting up of a Mega Chemical Industrial Estates (MCIE) in the private sector. The industrial estate would have a world class infrastructure and would be supported under the Industrial Infrastructure Upgradation scheme of Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India. National Policy on Petrochemicals A high-powered group of experts has studied the various facets of Petrochemicals Industry and has made recommendations for enhancing competitiveness and growth of this sector. Based on this report, the Department is now engaged in the formulation of a National Policy on Petrochemicals. Plastic Export Processing Zones The domestic downstream plastic processing industry is highly competitive and plastic processed articles are exported to both development and developing countries. The export performance of plastic processed articles in 2002-03 is Rs. 941 million with a growth of 17.35 pr cent. Pharmaceutical Export Pharmaceutical exports from India have crossed the five-digit figure in financial year 2003. As per statistics of Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCIS) the total value of pharma exports reached the figure of Rs.11925 crore. Compared to previous year’s figures export increased by about 21 per cent."

Reduction of Ash content in Coal The Government has made it mandatory to use coal of ash content not exceeding 34 per cent in any thermal power plant (TPP) located beyond 1000 kms. from pithead or located in urban area or sensitive area or critically polluted area. To satisfy this stipulation, coal supply matrix for TPPs coming under purview of MoEF’s notification has been drawn up and is under operation. Coal Bed Methane Project Gas emitting out of coal mines is a type of natural gas which can be used for industries depending on its composition, heat value and other infrastructure for use of the gas. A demonstration project namely Coal Bed Methane Recovery & Commercial Utilization has been taken up by government of India in collaboration with United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Global Environment Facility (GEF) at Moonidih and Sudamdih mines of Bharat Coking Coal Limited in Jharia Coalifields, District Dhanbad. The Central Mine Planning & Design Institute Limited (CMPDIL) is the main local implementing agency on behalf of Government of India. Bharat Coking Coal Limited is the co-implementing agency. Smart Cards Scheme launched The Coal Minister Shri Kariya Munda launched Smart Card Scheme for coal miners. Instituted by Coal Mines Provident Fund Organization (CMPFO) the Card enables an employee to examine his Provident Fund account without taking any trouble to visit the CMPFO office.

Safety Measures Measures taken for improving Safety measures were pursued for enhancement of safety in operations in Coalmines and also for community and peripheral development."
550,31-December-2003 17:4 IST,Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas,Year marked by acquisition of interest in producing Sudanese oil field in country’s march towards oil security NATIONAL AUTO FUEL POLICY FINALISED FOR IMPROVED ENVIRONMENT OIL COMPANIES’ PROFIT REGISTERS SHARP INCREASE IN THE POST-APM ERA,"YEAR END REVIEW 2003Efforts to enhance oil security of the country through accelerated steps for increasing domestic production of oil and gas and through acquisition of interest in oil fields abroad received a big boost during 2003. ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) completed acquisition of 25 per cent interest in the producing Greater Nile Oil Project in Sudan on 12th March, 2003. Under the first such deal OVL’s share comes to 3 million tonne per annum (MMTPA) from the Mumbai High size 12 MMTPA oil field and the first consignment of crude oil from abroad was received on 15th May at Mangalore Port. The event was of great significance in view of country’s 70% import dependence. Simultaneously contracts for 23 oil & gas exploration blocks were signed taking total blocks awarded to70 in first three rounds of global bidding under New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) besides 21 more approved for award under fourth round. Domestic exploration & production (E&P) efforts met a major success with 20 MMT inplace reserves oil discovery in block in Rajasthan in February 2003 and 30 MMT inplace reserves oil and gas discovery in Vasai East oil field of ONGC off Maharashtra Coast in March 2003. Besides, other oil and discoveries were also reported in Assam, Rajasthan, etc. To further augment the natural gas supply for bridging the demand and supply contract for 5 CBM blocks were signed on 6.2.2003 and another 8 blocks were awarded under the second round of Coal Bed Methane (CBM) Policy . In all 8 CBM Blocks contracted already including 3 awarded earlier, efforts are on to soon produce CBM gas which is the low pressure locally utilisable in power, fertilizer, city gas projects, etc. Simultaneously, gas import in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG) is progressing well as the LNG import project at Dahej (Gujarat) is almost complete to receive the first shipment in January 2004. In order to give boost to the exploration and production activities in the country, the Government has increased the rates of security deposit, annual licence fee, mining lease fee, etc., w.e.f. 1st April, 2003. This puts in place an effective mechanism for faster growth of the oil sector with fuller support of the State Governments. The amended rates are in line with the global practices to subserve the recent developments in hydrocarbon sector which aims at accelerating the efforts to find more oil and gas in the country. The initiative to address country’s oil security needs was fructified with the receipt of India’s first consignment of crude oil from equity oil abroad on 15th May at Mangalore Port from the Greater Nile Oil Project, Sudan in which ONGC Videsh (OVL) took over 25% stake in the Project from Talisman Energy of Canada. The first ever acquisition of a large producing field by India overseas is a landmark in the oil history of India and a path-breaking step forward towards oil security of the country and assumes great significance in view of the country’s heavy import dependence and the strategic importance of uninterrupted supplies of Petroleum products. Government allocated 15 lakh tonnes of Ravva crude to Bongaigaon Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd. (BRPL) from the year 2003-04. This will increase the availability of crude to the refineries in North-East which have been facing difficulty of under utilisation of their refining capacity of 7 million metric tonnes per annum (MMTPA) as around 5 MMTPA crude was available in North-East earlier. The allocation to BRPL obviated the immediate need for capital investment of about Rs. 500 crore by BRPL to produce Euro-II fuels. The refineries in North-East are of sub-economic size and suffer from locational disadvantages. These refineries, keeping in view the government’s policy to stimulate industrial development and to provide for socio-economic development in North-East region, are being operated despite being economically unviable. Oil companies have so far invested about Rs. 10,000 crore in refineries to upgrade the fuel quality to Bharat Stage-I all over the country and Bharat Stage-II in 11 major cities. To the benefit of oil producing states the Government revised the rate and the principle of fixing royalty on crude oil which was Rs. 578/tonne earlier to about Rs. 1200 per tonne depending upon the international price. The States would benefit as royalty rates were in between revised upward on three occasions on adhoc basis before finalisation of the present ad valorem royalty regime on 4.2.2003. The National Auto Fuel Policy was laid on the Table of the Lok Sabha. The policy provides a clear cut road map for changes in vehicular technology and corresponding fuel quality for the whole country. Measures are also proposed to reduce emissions from in-use vehicles. It is expected that the implementation of the policy would lead to better ambient air quality which will reflect through improvement in public health and better environment. The Government formulated draft Natural Gas Pipeline Policy for the development of natural gas sector and optimum utilisation of the gas available from various sources in the country. In accordance with the draft Policy, transportation of all gas is envisaged to be done through a network of pipelines laid with the authorisation granted by the Regulator through a transparent mechanism. As per the draft Policy all trunk pipelines covering more than one State or operating at a pressure more than the notified level will be built/managed by a company to be notified by the Government, and till it is notified by GAIL. It is proposed to set up a National Gas Grid consisting of 7,000 Km long pipeline network at a cost of around Rs. 18,000 crore over the next 5-6 years. Further, any producer of gas, subject to prior permission of the Regulator (and Central Government for the PSUs) will have the right to sell gas within 100 Kms. of well-head or land-fall point to consumers directly and lay the pipeline for this purpose. The Minister of Petroleum & Natural Gas, Shri Ram Naik complimented the 12 oil PSUs under the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas for outstanding performance in the year 2002-03, which he described as a watershed for the oil industry. The oil sector was opened up for competition in the post-APM era, in all spheres which included exploration and production, refining, marketing of products and pipeline. In the first year post-APM, the net profits of oil PSUs registered an impressive increase of 83 per cent to Rs. 23,250 crore from Rs. 12,700 crore in 2001-02. in combined net profit of PSUs in 2002-03 is 4 ½ times of the paid up capital of Rs.5200 crore. He exhorted the oil PSUs to come good while facing the challenge of maintaining these excellent figures of profitability in future. At the same time, the benefits of competition and de-regulation were passed on to the consumers in the form reduction in prices of petrol and diesel, (4 times) marking a departure from earlier practice when prices of these products never came down. Oil PSUs did not increase the prices of LPG and Kerosene in the interest of consumers in household sector and the consumers from weaker sections of the society even in the face of volatility in international market. Furthermore, the Cabinet, in its meeting of 11th September deliberated upon the issue of pricing of PDS Kerosene and Domestic LPG and decided that the selling price of these products would not be increased by the oil marketing companies during the current financial year. The Cabinet also decided to increase the phasing out period for subsidies on these products from three years to five years with effect from 1st April 2002 i.e. the subsidies will now be available upto 31.03.2007. The Government has approved the proposal for preponing the date of introducing Bharat Stage-II emission norms compliant fuels in the cities of Lucknow (Uttar Pradesh) and Sholapur (Maharashtra). Accordingly, the petrol and diesel with 0.05 per cent maximum sulphur content petrol and diesel would be supplied in these cities w.e.f. 1.1.2004 instead of 1.4.2005 as per Auto Fuel Policy. Presently, petrol and diesel with 0.25% sulphur content are being supplied all over the country from January 2000 including Lucknow and Sholapur excepting 11 other cities which have Bharat Stage-II fuels. The supply of 5 per cent ethanol blended petrol, called ""Gasohol"" was launched by the Government on January 1, 2003. Out of 255 Districts notified in nine States and four UTs which were to be supplied with ethanol blended petrol by 30th September 2003, 205 Districts have been covered so far including 16 Districts in part. Out of the remaining 50 Districts 32 fall in Tamilnadu (29) and Pondicherry (3) where the programme is being kept in abeyance. Of the 16 Districts covered in part, 12 are in the State of Andhra Pradesh and 4 in Gujarat. There are 18 uncovered Districts in Gujarat, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh and the UT of Daman & Diu which will be fully covered by 31.12.2003. Ethanol-petrol blending programme is further extended to the States of Madhya Pradesh and Uttaranchal from 1st January 2004. Ethanol blended petrol carries an excise duty concession of 30 paise per litre. The additional excise duty on petrol has been reduced from the normal rate of Rs. 6 per litre to Rs. 5.70 per litre for petrol to be sold after blending with ethanol, as per the notification issued by the Finance Ministry. To encourage the use of ethanol in petrol, the Government has requested the States to exempt the sales tax payable on ethanol to be used for blending with petrol. Further, in order to supplement availability of hydro-carbons in the country, the Government is aiming at commencing implementation of blending bio-diesel with the diesel up to 20% by the year 2011-12. There would be a greater emphasis on producing bio-diesel from non-edible plants as the edible oil in India is in short supply. For producing bio-diesel mainly the plants like neem, mahua, karanja, kusum, jatropa etc., can be grown. Plants like jatropa have a characteristic of growing in areas with scarcity of water, deserts and in wasteland. Besides having advantages to blend bio-diesel with diesel and producing other bio-fuels, these initiatives are crucial to the energy security of the country and to reduce the ill effects of pollution caused by conventional fuels. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Cooperation in Hydrocarbon Sector between India and Iran was signed during the visit of Iranian Delegation in January this year. The MoU has been finalized in the background of significant potential for cooperation between the two countries in the Hydrocarbon sector including the Farsi Block by ONGC Videsh Consortium. The MoU seeks to establish a framework for cooperation in specific areas of Hydrocarbon Sector, ranging from Exploration and Production, Supply of Hydrocarbons, both oil and gas, services sector, R&D sector etc. This was followed by another agreement reached between the two countries in the first meeting of Indo-Iran Joint Working Group in Iran in May 2003 to formulate a package of importing 5 MMT LNG in phases from Iran to India and participating interests for Indian PSUs like OVL in appropriate discovered and semi-discovered oil and gas fields. The LNG project envisaged would have a period of 25 years. Indian Oil Corporation made its maiden entry in retail market abroad with the launch of Lanka IOC at Colombo in May 2003. LIOC’s first modernised RO as part of a chain of 100 ROs took over from Ceylon Petroleum Corporation in addition to 150 more franchisee ROs to be taken over in phases. IOC also took on lease Sri Lanka’s product storage tankage of 1 million tonne capacity at Triconamalee for modernisation and operations for mutual benefit. IOC will also supply 1 million tonne products every year to Sri Lanka from the refinery of its subsidiary Chennai Petroleum Corporation Limited. Shell India Pvt. Ltd. (SIPL), a subsidiary of Shell Group of Companies, was granted authorisation for marketing transportation fuels in the country subject to the company furnishing Bank Guarantee to the Government of Rs. 500 crore towards fulfilling the commitment to invest Rs. 2,000 crore in the building of infrastructure in the hydrocarbon sector. SIPL has plans to set up around 2,000 retail outlets spread all over the country of which 11% will be in remote/low service areas. Likewise, ONGC was also granted authorisation to set up additional 500 ROs in the country. With the rejuvenation of MRPL by ONGC acquiring majority stake in the refinery, ONGC will become a fully integrated company by opening retail outlets which can be easily fed from MRPL. Indian Oil Corporation, with an initial capital support of Rs. 2 crore, entered the select club of global providers of Hydrocarbon technology and process formulations developed by the Indian Oil R&D Centre located at Faridabad (Haryana). IndianOil Technologies Limited has a vision of evolving into a leader in technology provider through excellence in management of knowledge, technology and innovation. It aims to add value to Indian Oil’s intellectual property through Consultancy, Licensing and providing specialized services by commercially exploiting indigenous cutting-edge technologies. The proven technologies of Indian Oil’s R&D Centre is being offered to the refineries of India as well as to the petroleum companies of the Middle East, South East Asia and African markets. A Laboratory at the R&D Centre of Indian Oil Corporation Limited at Faridabad was set up at an investment of about Rs. 34 crore to develop new technologies for producing value added products like LPG, Needle Coke, etc., from crude oil residues. The laboratory houses pilot plants dedicated for various upgradation and related processes. Security Deposit on domestic LPG cylinder of 14.2 Kg. weight was reduced by Rs. 50/- w.e.f. 1.3.2003 thus the security deposit came to Rs. 650/- per cylinder from the Rs. 700/- per cylinder. First LPG Bottling Plant of Andaman & Nicobar Islands was commissioned at Port Blair on 20.4.2003. Manmad-Indore pipeline of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (BPCL) was inaugurated on 12th September. Distributors’ commission increased on domestic LPG by 38 paise on a 14.2 kg. cylinder and by 20 paise on a 5 kg. cylinder w.e.f. 1st October, 2003. Over 7 crore Indian families are using LPG as cooking fuel. India stands second to China in LPG consumer population. The Government approved the proposal to provide subsidised LPG for all School & College Hostels, Government/Municipal Hospitals, Social Welfare institutions like child/women welfare homes, old age homes, homes for disabled etc., and for implementing Mid-day Meal Schemes. Following the dismantling of Administered Price Mechanism (APM) a number of administrative orders/circulars were withdrawn and the subsidised LPG became available for only domestic use. This resulted in sharp increase in the cost of procurement of LPG to Rs. 650 for 19 Kg. Cylinder at commercial rates by the consumers in these categories. These were earlier eligible for getting subsidised LPG at domestic rate of about Rs. 250 for 14.2 Kg. Cylinder. The price of LPG nearly doubled to about Rs. 34.2 per kg. from about Rs. 17.6 per kg. The 5th International Petroleum Conference – Petrotech 2003 was held in New Delhi from 9.1.2003 to 11.1.2003. The three-day event was preceded by inauguration of an Exhibition by Shri Ram Naik, Minister of Petroleum & Natural Gas at Pragati Maidan, New Delhi. DGH in association with PETRAD of Norway organised a three-day Seminar on ""Development of Deepwater Discoveries – Challenges and New Technologies"" in New Delhi from 25th to 27th March. Over 350 delegates, scientists and research scholars from India and abroad attended the three-day International Workshop on Hydrogen Energy organised by Indian Oil Corporation from 11th December to 13th December. The Government approved a proposal for implementation of Voluntary Retirement Schemes (VRS) in Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Indian Oil Corporation (IOC). The approved schemes are in line with the guidelines of Department of Public Enterprises (DPE). In appreciation of the remarkable performance of the special category young boys and girls of India in Special Olympics 2003 at Dublin (Ireland) the oil PSUs donated Rs. One crore to award each of the 34 gold medal winners a cash prize of Rs. 1,00,000/-, 36 silver medal winners Rs. 50,000/- and 40 bronze medal winners Rs. 25,000/- and further made a contribution of Rs. 38,00,000/- to the Special Olympics Bharat Trust which organised the events on behalf of India, thus making the total amount to Rs. 1 crore. IOC donated four Ambulances for the use of people in the Andaman & Nicobar Islands are being donated by Indian Oil Corporation (IOC). These Ambulances will be used for ferrying patients to hospitals in different regions of the Andaman & Nicobar Islands which include Car Nicobar, Rangat, Diglipur and Port Blair. The operations and maintenance of these ambulances will be looked after by the organisations engaged in serving the people across the Andaman & Nicobar Islands. 312 Petrol Pumps & LPG Agencies made operational for the families of Kargil Martyrs. Oil companies in the country are set to launch the nation’s first Hydrogen gas dispensing stations in select cities in the next two to three years, which will serve as a pilot project to prove the efficacy of Hydrogen gas as a clean and environment-friendly automotive fuel. An exclusive fleet of two- and three-wheelers, which can use Hydrogen gas in admixture with CNG (Compressed Natural Gas), would be another option arising out of this pilot project. The Government set up an Independent Inquiry Committee headed by Shri T. S. Vijayaraghavan, a former Secretary to Government of India in the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas to look into the safety and security related aspects of offshore operations of ONGC submitted its interim report on 2.12.2003. The committee was set up in the aftermath of ONGC Copter crash off-Mumbai Coast on 11th August, 2003"

554,31-December-2003 11:19 IST,Ministry of Science & Technology,First phase of Biodiversity characterisation complete report on Andaman Nicobar Islands relesed,"The first phase of the Biodiversity characterisation at landscape level is complete with the release of the report on Andaman and Nicobar islands. The report on other three priority areas namely North-Eastern region, Western Ghats and Western Himalayas was released in January this year. In all four priority areas were taken up in the first phase by the Department of Biotechnology in collaboration with Department of Space using Satellite Remote Sensing and Geographic Information system. The Andaman and Nicobar islands report was released by eminent scientist Prof. M.G.K.Menon, at a national seminar organised jointly by the two departments here today on “Biodiversity characterisation at landscape level for Bioprospecting”. In his inaugural address, the Chairman ISRO and Secretary, Department of Space, Dr. G. Madhavan Nair said, that with the launching of RESOURCESAT-1, Biodiversity characterisation has become a bit easier. Multi-spectral capability provides us with the kind of resolution which makes the task more accurate and precise. He also said that IRS-1C and IRS-1D have been providing valuable and comprehensive data for the project. He also spoke on the need to preserve and sustain our biodiversity not only for our needs but also for global requirements. Prof. M.G.K.Menon said, the society has been plundering its biodiversity more for greed than for need and it is time that we thought of concrete measures to conserve our ecology, while sustaining the same. They have to go hand in hand. Our rich biodiversity has to be safe-guarded, for it has a significant role in agriculture and health, in the distant future. In her welcome address, the Secretary, Department of Biotechnology, Dr. Manju Sharma said that the second phase of the project has already begun in the remaining important regions like, central India, Eastern Ghats and Mangroves of East Coast. Biodiversity assessment at different levels is of prime importance to evolve conservation strategies and sustainable utilisation, she said."
