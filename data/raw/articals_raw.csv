On the surface, both look similar because the money ultimately reaches equity in instalments. But beneath that simplicity, the journey, the behaviour required, and even the final outcome can be very different. A SIP is built for someone who earns regularly and wants investing to feel effortless. “If you earn every month and can only invest a little at a time, then SIP is the right choice for you to invest regularly, and over time your money keeps growing without having to worry about the best time to enter the market,” says Raghvendra Nath, Managing Director, Ladderup Asset Managers. With an STP, the story unfolds differently. It works only when you already have a lump sum waiting to be deployed. Instead of putting it all into equity on day one, you park it in a liquid fund and slowly shift it into equity. The advantage here is not subtle: while the money waits, it earns higher returns. Aditya Agarwal, Co-Founder of Wealthy.in, says, “If the entire money is available with the investor on day one, then the STP route is always a better choice.” This is because money parked in the Liquid Fund (in case of STP) will result in accumulating slightly higher capital gain than savings account interest earned (in case of SIP). This is the crucial difference. In the SIP scenario, the uninvested money often sits in a savings account earning barely 3 per cent. In the STP route, the idle money earns closer to 6 per cent. Over a year, this changes the maths meaningfully. Consider this:  One investor puts Rs 10,000 into an equity fund every month through a SIP, leaving the rest of the money in a savings account. Another has Rs 1.2 lakh upfront and uses a 12-month STP, shifting Rs 10,000 into equity each month. On the surface, both invest the same amount, but what happens over those 12 months makes the two strategies play out very differently. ""In both the cases of SIP and STP, money is usually transferred to equity funds from Savings A/c and Liquid Funds, respectively. So, though an equity fund’s return will be similar in both cases (as amount and frequency are the same), interest/gains earned from Savings A/c and Liquid Funds will be different. If we assume a return from savings a/c as 3 percent, a return from Liquid Funds as 6 percent, and a return from equity fund as 12 percent, interest earned on savings account will be Rs 1,682 while gains from the liquid fund will be Rs 4,026,""  explains Agarwal.  But does that mean STP always wins? Not quite. Karan Aggarwal, Co-founder & CIO, Elever, highlights a nuance that many investors overlook. ""The time diversification benefits of STP can be capped by the period of contribution. For example, if an investor had run out of money by December 2007, he would have missed buying at a dip during the 2008 GFC.” A SIP continues for years and naturally catches deep market corrections. An STP is limited to the months you choose at the start. If the big dip happens after your STP finishes, you simply miss it. Yet, STP carries a behavioural strength that many investors silently crave. Aggarwal says, “STP represents a defined commitment within a timeline which psychologically helps investors by removing aspects of decision-making during big market moves.” SIPs are essentially designed to help investors build wealth over time, and taxes arise only when you choose to redeem. Each monthly contribution is treated as a fresh investment, so the tax outcome reflects how long those units have been held, with equity SIPs earning favorable long-term capital gains treatment (12.5 percent) once they cross the one-year mark. This makes SIPs a clean and effective way to compound wealth. STPs, by contrast, are used to gradually move money from one fund to another, and each transfer out of the source fund is treated as a redemption, which triggers capital-gains tax at every step, explains Nath. If you are a salaried individual building wealth brick by brick, a SIP fits your rhythm. If you come into a lump sum through a bonus, maturity, or inheritance and want to avoid timing the market, an STP gives structure and efficiency. In many ways, SIP is a wealth-building habit. STP is a wealth-deployment strategy. One is a lifestyle, the other is a tactic. “Different situations, different choices, both are useful in their own way,” sums up Nath.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/sip-of-rs-10-000-from-your-savings-account-or-an-stp-from-a-rs-1-2-lakh-liquid-fund-which-works-better-13715254.html

The industrial metal climbed as much as 1.3% to $11,771 a ton, blazing past a record set in the previous session. The latest spike came after Beijing said on Monday it would stick with a “more proactive” fiscal approach and maintain a “moderately loose” monetary stance for the world’s second-largest economy. “The Politburo readouts present a more proactive macro environment than investors have expected,” said Xu Wanqiu, an analyst with Chinese brokerage Cofco Futures Co.. “Copper will benefit from policy support toward power-grid upgrades, computing power. The momentum remains very bullish,” she said. Trade data from China was also supportive, with exports rebounding last month to beat estimates and push the country’s trade surplus past $1 trillion for the first time in any year. Copper – a metal critical for electrification and the energy transition – has gained more than 30% on the London Metal Exchange this year. New demand fueled by data centers and electric vehicles has come up against tight global supply, with smelting capacity growing faster than mines can keep up. A series of mine outages has exacerbated a shortage of raw materials. The rally has accelerated in recent weeks on concerns over an exodus of the metal to the US in anticipation that President Donald Trump will impose tariffs next year. This has squeezed inventories and sent premiums elsewhere to unprecedented highs, while also causing futures in New York to spike above those on the LME. Global supply of refined copper could see a shortfall of 450,000 tons in 2026, partly due to this stockpiling in America, analysts from Chinese brokerage Citic Securities Co. said in a note. Prices must average above $12,000 a ton next year to attract the investment needed in new mining capacity to ensure sufficient supply in the medium- to long-term, the Citic analysts, led by Ao Chong, said. Copper was up 0.8% at $11,713 a ton on the LME as of 7:18 a.m in London. Other metals were mostly higher, with zinc up 0.8% and aluminum 0.5%.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/copper-climbs-to-record-as-china-policy-us-imports-spur-rally-13715182.html
2,Business,"Budget 2026 expectations: Mandatory employer health cover, speedy motor claims, transparent commissions","December 08, 2025 / 13:04 IST","As we move towards the Union Budget, conversations naturally centre on growth, capital and investment. These are essential but sustainable progress depends just as much on protection. A single hospitalisation pushing a family into debt, a shopkeeper losing stock in a flood, a small factory shutting after a cyclone, or an accident victim waiting years for compensation; these incidents quietly weaken economic momentum and confidence. India has already shown how transformative policy design can be in sectors such as digital payments, identity, taxation and health. Insurance can be the next major catalyst. Yet, according to Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India’s annual report, overall insurance penetration in India is only 3.7 percent, far below the global average of 7 percent, with general insurance at about a percent. On behalf of the general insurance industry, my pre-budget recommendations rest on a simple premise: treat insurance as social infrastructure, an essential system that protects citizens, businesses and public investment. Five reforms can help accelerate this shift. MSMEs are central to India’s economy. According to PIB, the Ministry of MSME and NITI Aayog, they contribute 29–30 percent of GDP, 36 percent of manufacturing output, 45 percent of exports, and employ over 12 crore people. But they remain highly exposed to climate-related risks. Swiss Re estimates that natural catastrophes caused $12 billion in economic losses in 2023, compared with an annual average of $8 billion over the previous decade. Between 2018 and 2022, India suffered $32.94 billion in uninsured catastrophe losses, with 93 percent of exposures uninsured. To reduce this vulnerability, we have proposed a National MSME Protection Scheme, linked to Udyam and Udyam Assist, which can become mandatory in stages. The scheme includes: This framework enables quicker recovery, protects jobs and reduces stress on the credit system by lowering post-disaster loan defaults. Even modest reductions in climate-related output losses can generate large economic savings. We have also recommended removing the Rs 5-crore cap on the sum insured for commercial risks sourced through banks, NBFCs and microfinance institutions. This change will also enable banks to play a stronger role in the surety business, unlocking long-term guarantees for contractors and projects and giving a substantial boost to India’s infrastructure growth. With 3.8 crore MSMEs registered on the Udyam portal, enabling financial partners to offer larger covers will strengthen manufacturing, support Make in India and Atmanirbhar Bharat, and improve climate resilience.

The NITI Aayog estimates more than 40 crore people, or about 30 percent of the population, fall into this segment. Out-of-pocket expenditure has fallen from 62.6 percent in 2014–15 to 39.4 percent in 2021–22 (National Health Accounts) yet it remains high by global standards. The WHO estimates that excessive medical spending pushes 55 million Indians into poverty each year, and 17 percent of households face catastrophic health expenses. To strengthen health protection, we have proposed a mandatory employer-employee health insurance framework for the organised sector covering full-time, contractual and gig workers. Implementation can be phased, with thresholds based on employer size or turnover. Employers may purchase minimum-standard group covers or link employees to approved government schemes. Tax incentives can encourage coverage of low-wage and missing-middle employees, and CSR rules can recognise health cover for contractual workers as eligible CSR spend. This framework protects families from medical distress, supports employers through healthier workforces and reduces pressure on public hospitals. It also advances the national vision of Insurance for All by 2047. When households know that treatment costs will not erode their savings, they consume, invest and plan with more confidence. According to the MoRTH Road Accidents in India 2023 report, India recorded 4.81 lakh accidents and 1.73 lakh fatalities in 2023, with individuals aged 18–45 accounting for nearly two-thirds of deaths. Many claimants face long delays in Motor Accident Claims Tribunals (MACT). To address this, we have proposed an Appellate Fast Track Motor Third-Party Claims Settlement Framework for clear-liability cases. This uses the Detailed Accident Report (DAR), FIR, and digital evidence for a quick liability assessment, and applies standardised compensation grids based on actuarial tables and Supreme Court principles. Claimants receive a digital settlement offer, which they can accept for a payout within a week or pursue through the tribunal with full rights intact. This approach speeds up compensation, reduces litigation costs and meaningfully lowers MACT workloads. For affected households, timely financial support improves recovery and stability. Policyholders today mostly see the total premium and basic policy coverage. They rarely know how much of their payment goes toward the risk pool, commissions or operating expenses. Strengthening trust requires clearer information. We have recommended a Unified Commission and Expense Disclosure Framework for retail health and motor policies. Every policy should clearly display, both in rupees and percentages: - The commission on that specific policy and intermediary type - Estimated management and operating expenses - The amount allocated to the risk pool and claims Such disclosures in policy documents, digital journeys, and on platforms such as Bima Sugam will help policyholders compare offerings more effectively. Transparent pricing discourages aggressive commission-driven selling and supports simpler, value-oriented products. Over time, this strengthens trust and participation in insurance. Also read | Rising silver prices nudge families to unlock value from old silver Today, insurance data is spread across insurers, intermediaries, government schemes and multiple digital platforms. This fragmentation makes it difficult for citizens to verify entities and for policymakers to track protection gaps. The concern is amplified by India’s natural catastrophe protection gap, which exceeds 90 percent (Swiss Re). To address this, we propose building a Unified Public Insurance Registry (UPIR) by upgrading the Insurance Information Bureau into a statutory digital public infrastructure hosted on the Bima Sugam platform. The idea is: every entity in the insurance ecosystem, insurers, intermediaries, garages, hospitals and other partners, should be part of a single verified repository. This simplifies verification and reduces the ability of fraudulent actors to operate. Universal inclusion and easier authentication are the core objectives of this registry. - A single source of truth for all licensed insurers, intermediaries and service providers - A registry of approved insurance products with citizen-friendly summaries - A secure, anonymised repository of policy and claims data up to the pin-code level - Analytical tools for regulators and policymakers - A citizen-facing layer for verification and, over time, unified policy management This strengthens trust, reduces fraud, improves service delivery and gives policymakers real-time insights to better target schemes and identify under-protected regions. Just as UPI transformed payments, a unified insurance registry can support the vision of Insurance for All by 2047. These reforms create an integrated architecture for resilience: MSME protection for economic continuity, workplace health cover to address the missing middle, quicker settlements for motor accident victims, greater transparency to build trust and a unified registry to strengthen governance. As an industry, we are ready to partner with the Government, IRDAI, and state authorities to co-invest in technology, improve data quality and disclosures, and help design and scale these frameworks. The Budget can reinforce that protection is not separate from growth; it is what allows growth to endure. When a shop reopens quickly after a flood, when a worker avoids distress during a medical emergency, when an accident victim receives timely compensation and when citizens can verify their insurance details with confidence, we strengthen the foundations of Viksit Bharat. That is the India we hope to help build: secure, prepared and confident in its future.

4,Business,Goa nightclub blaze: CM Sawant drops major clue on what sparked it,"December 08, 2025 / 11:11 IST","The Goa nightclub tragedy that claimed 25 lives may have been sparked by “electric firecrackers” set off inside the packed venue, Chief Minister Pramod Sawant has said, citing a preliminary inquiry. The North Goa club, Birch by Romeo Lane in Arpora, was bustling with weekend crowds when a massive fire ripped through it around 11.45 pm on Saturday. The blaze exposed layers of illegalities, rule violations, and official complacency that allowed the establishment to operate without even a fire department NOC, according to officials quoted by PTI. Sawant said early findings point to the use of electric firecrackers inside the premises. Most victims died of suffocation after getting trapped on the ground floor and in the kitchen. Firefighters said narrow lanes blocked their vehicles, forcing water tankers to halt nearly 400 metres away. Small exits and a narrow bridge made escape even harder. The fire killed 20 staff members and five tourists, including four from Delhi. Many workers were from Uttarakhand, Jharkhand, Assam, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Nepal. Police have arrested four managers of the club, while an FIR has been registered against owners Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra and the event organisers. Three senior government officials have been suspended for clearing the nightclub’s operations in 2023 despite violations. Eyewitnesses told PTI the fire may have first erupted on the first floor where tourists were dancing. One survivor, Riya from Delhi, said firecrackers burst around dancers shortly before flames swept through the club, causing panic and a stampede-like situation. Another survivor, Fatima Shaikh from Hyderabad, said people ran downstairs into the kitchen, where many eventually got trapped. Temporary structures made of palm leaves caught fire within moments, turning the space into an inferno. The state government has announced Rs five lakh ex-gratia for the families of each victim and Rs 50,000 for the injured. Arrangements are being made to send the bodies to their home states. Sawant said an audit of all clubs operating without permission or with high footfall will now be undertaken. *With PTI inputs",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/goa-nightclub-blaze-cm-sawant-drops-major-clue-on-what-sparked-it-13714730.html
5,Business,Understanding risk in debt funds — and how to stay cautious while investing,"December 08, 2025 / 13:00 IST","Debt funds often get introduced to new investors as the “safer cousin” of equity. The logic sounds simple — while equity chases growth, debt focuses on stability. But stability does not mean absence of risk. Debt funds don’t fluctuate like stocks, yet they carry their own set of moving parts: interest rates, credit quality, liquidity, fund strategy and market cycles. Many investors enter expecting fixed-deposit-like comfort and then panic when they see negative returns during a volatile period. Understanding risk is less about fear and more about knowing what to expect. When you know where risk sits, you learn how to avoid stepping directly on it. Debt fund returns move inversely to interest rates. When rates fall, existing bonds with higher coupons look attractive and fund values rise. When rates rise, those same bonds lose appeal, leading to mark-to-market losses. On paper, this sounds technical. In real life, it means your debt fund can temporarily show lower or even negative returns in a rising-rate environment. Short-duration funds feel fluctuations mildly. Long-duration and gilt funds feel it strongly. Many investors who chased long-term debt funds during falling rate cycles later felt uncomfortable when rates reversed. The risk isn’t hidden — it is just rarely explained clearly at the point of purchase. Some debt funds promise better returns by lending to lower-rated companies. The logic is simple: higher risk, higher yield. But if a borrower delays repayment or defaults, the fund must write down the investment, and NAV falls. Credit events don’t happen daily, but when they do, impact feels sudden and emotional. A high credit-risk fund is not bad by default — it just needs awareness. If you want higher yield, you accept higher credit vulnerability. If peace of mind matters more, sticking to higher-rated papers or government securities brings comfort. The risk is not in the product, but in choosing one that doesn’t match your tolerance. Debt funds let you redeem quickly, but that liquidity depends on how easily the underlying securities can be sold. In normal markets, no one notices. During stress — think sudden rate hikes or credit scares — selling lower-rated bonds becomes tougher. If many investors rush to redeem at once, the fund manager might need to liquidate holdings at lower prices, affecting NAV for everyone. This risk remains quiet until it becomes loud. Investors who don’t need instant liquidity rarely face issues. Those who want easy exit in turbulent markets need to choose funds with diversified holdings and strong credit quality. Sometimes, funds hold a large part of their portfolio in a small number of issuers. When these issuers are stable, returns look strong. If one issuer weakens, the whole fund feels it. Concentration risk isn’t always visible unless you check the portfolio breakdown. Browsing a fund’s factsheet once a quarter gives clarity. You don’t need to analyse deeply — just check whether exposure is spread across multiple issuers and sectors. Diversification is a quiet shield. A short-term investor entering a long-duration fund is asking for volatility. Duration amplifies rate movements. Someone investing for a year but choosing a five-year duration fund may face unpredictable short-term swings. On the other hand, long-term investors who choose short-duration funds might miss potential upside in rate-fall cycles. The key isn’t timing the cycle — it’s matching horizon with product. Patience can neutralise volatility more effectively than prediction. Tax rules evolve, and so do valuation norms. Sometimes the change favours investors — sometimes it compresses returns. Regulatory tweaks rarely break portfolios, but they can influence post-tax outcome. Investors planning multi-year debt exposure should stay aware of taxation slabs, indexation rules and category-specific norms. For most people, a periodic review or a conversation with an advisor once a year is enough. You don’t need to track every headline. The goal of understanding risk is not to avoid debt funds. It is to place them in your portfolio thoughtfully. They stabilise returns, balance equity volatility and provide options for medium-term goals. But they must be chosen with the same seriousness you give to equity. If you want safety over returns — stick to high-quality liquid, ultra-short or money-market funds. If you want higher returns and accept risk — consider credit-risk funds consciously. If you want to benefit from falling interest-rate cycles — longer-duration categories work, but only with patience. Returns here aren’t about thrill — they’re about steadiness. And steady money, when understood properly, often builds more confidence than fast money ever can",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/understanding-risk-in-debt-funds-and-how-to-stay-cautious-while-investing-13715211.html
6,Business,OPINION | ‘Fraud-stack’ can’t be defeated by front-door surveillance,"December 08, 2025 / 12:58 IST","The story begins, as many policy panics do, with a crisis. Across government departments and regulators, senior officials are staring at charts that rise too fast and fall too slowly: scam calls sweeping the country, cyber-fraud syndicates evolving faster than enforcement, FATF sanctions architecture-driven broken-KYC loopholes spawning endless impersonations, and citizens losing money at a scale that can no longer be hidden in outdated calculations showing fraud as a small proportion of transaction volumes. The question always ends with: “Why can’t we catch these people?” It is in this climate of urgency, and a lot of institutional embarrassment, that a dramatic proposal seems to be taking shape: to require all smartphone manufacturers to keep satellite-based location tracking permanently enabled, giving the state a clear, continuous view of a device’s movements. Not on request. Not during emergencies. Not with warrants. The logic is seductive in its simplicity. Fraudsters are elusive; precise tracking might help corner them. But desperation is a poor designer of public policy and always produces ill-effects even as a first-order effect. For the truth is this: India’s fraud crisis is grave, but redesigning every smartphone into a surveillance device is not a remedy. It is an over-correction so sweeping that it risks killing the very foundations of a society in the digital era. Fraudsters do not thrive because citizens can switch off their GPS; they thrive because the enforcement ecosystem meant to catch them is running on archaic machinery. Investigative pipelines still move at analogue speed in a digital age, struggling to keep pace with criminals who operate with agility and anonymity. Inter-agency coordination is uneven, often leaving vital intelligence stranded in silos rather than stitched into actionable insight. Compounding this are deeper structural weaknesses. Telecom distribution networks continue to harbour pockets of corruption that allow fraudulent SIMs and compromised identities to slip through the cracks. Bank officials often collude to open bank accounts to facilitate money laundering. Cyber-policing capacity varies dramatically across states, creating uneven lines of defence, while international cooperation against cross-border fraud syndicates remains sluggish and bureaucratically heavy. Faced with this messy, multi-layered reality, it is tempting for the state to reach for a shortcut: if the plumbing is so broken that sewage floods often, why not re-engineer the whole house and the people who live in it? The problems that cripple fraud enforcement lie within systems and institutions, not in the privacy settings of ordinary citizens. Mandating always-on A-GPS tracking would mark a radical departure from India’s surveillance norms. Today, the state must request location data through telecom providers, however imperfectly. Under the proposed regime, the state would not request: it would receive, silently, perpetually. This shifts the presumption at the heart of the Republic: from targeted scrutiny of suspects to ambient tracking of everyone. Supporters of this idea often lean on a familiar refrain: “law-abiding citizens have nothing to fear.” But freedom to be oneself is not protected by innocence; it is protected by the ability not to be watched without cause. A country that normalises round-the-clock tracking of everyone to fight cybercrime will unleash so much distrust among people that it will destroy the already fragile societal trust within communities. And what comes after is a well-known and worn lesson of history – a transition of a society of demos into that of helots. Mass surveillance may begin as an anti-fraud tool, but it rarely stays that way. What makes the proposal more perplexing is its timing. India is simultaneously positioning itself as a global force in ethical digital governance: championing data localisation, exporting India Stack, and enacting privacy legislation, at least in aspiration. How then does a nation present itself as a guardian of user data on the world stage, while considering a policy that would harvest the clearest, most intimate data of all—one’s physical movements without pause or consent? Even China, despite its expansive surveillance apparatus, does not publicly mandate always-on, hardware-level location tracking on every smartphone. To adopt it would make India a global outlier—for reasons that diminish rather than enhance its digital credibility. A credible response to fraud demands strengthening the state’s capabilities and not simultaneously shrinking citizens’ rights to non-existence. That means building modern cyber-forensics units, enabling real-time fraud-intelligence sharing between banks, fintechs and telecom companies, and re-imagining KYC given its now well-documented failures when stress-tested by fraudsters at scale. It also requires cleansing corruption within telecom and banking distribution chains, where weak points often become entry gates for fraudulent identities. Equally essential is judicially-monitored access to sensitive data—oversight that ensures the state’s powers are targeted, proportionate and accountable. And across states, cyber-policing capacity must become more uniform; enforcement cannot depend on geography or administrative luck. Inter-state coordination must work without collapsing under bureaucratic weight at precisely the moments when speed matters most. These reforms are unglamorous. They demand patience, investment and transparency –– qualities harder to cultivate than passing a sweeping secret directive. But rights-eroding shortcuts are the last refuge of systems unwilling to repair themselves, and no democracy should choose the dopamine of more unaccountable power over constitutional discipline. India’s digital future must not be built on fear —fear of bad press, fear of rising fraud numbers, fear of public outrage. Policies under pressure tend to expand state power faster than they strengthen public trust. The government recently withdrew the mandatory app-installation order after public alarm. That was a reminder that democratic course correction is still possible. It is needed again. Fraud demands tough solutions. But turning every citizen into a traceable coordinate is surrendering to the illusion that safety can be purchased by trading away liberty. India’s challenge is not to choose between privacy and security. It is to build a state competent enough not to pit one against the other. A nation state does not stay as one entity simply by fear and coercion of its citizenry. It stays as one because its citizens have the freedom to walk, travel, and simply exist without the state watching over every step. Freedom is the quiet space in which a society breathes. And it must not be switched off by switching on one mandatory GPS tracking system at a time. Mandatory phone tracking won’t stop fraud. It will only end privacy. After all, we did not rebel against the British Raj to escape becoming Macaulay-Putras to gain our freedom only to become Orwell-Putras 75 years later.

7,Business,Tata-Lockheed Martin break ground for new C-130J MRO hub in Bengaluru,"December 08, 2025 / 13:50 IST","Tata Advanced Systems and US defence giant Lockheed Martin, on Monday, broke ground for a new maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facility in Bengaluru to service C-130J Super Hercules military transport aircraft, marking a major boost to India’s aerospace sustainment capabilities. The move comes as the Tata-Lockheed Martin joint venture is pitching the C-130J Super Hercules for the Indian Air Force’s (IAF) upcoming mega procurement of around 80 heavy-lift transport aircraft. The IAF currently operates 12 C-130Js, considered among the world’s most capable tactical airlifters. Senior IAF officials, government representatives, and top executives from both companies attended the ceremony. Lockheed Martin Chief Operating Officer Frank St. John said the groundbreaking underscores the depth of the company’s long-standing partnership with India. “For more than seven decades, we've grown alongside India's expanding aerospace and defence industrial base. This new C-130 MRO facility strengthens that foundation,” he said, adding that the project will enhance IAF readiness and create opportunities for regional and global C-130 operators. Tata Advanced Systems CEO and MD Sukaran Singh said the facility reflects India’s rising capability and ambition in defence manufacturing. “This milestone represents India’s growing confidence in shaping its own defence future. The MRO venture strengthens our aerospace ecosystem with new opportunities for innovation, skill development, and global competitiveness,” he noted. The state-of-the-art facility will handle heavy maintenance, component repair, overhauls, structural checks, avionics upgrades, and structural restoration for the C-130J fleet. It will also enable expanded training for Indian engineers and maintainers, and open new avenues for domestic suppliers in the C-130 supply chain. Tata Advanced Systems, which already manufactures C-130 empennages and aerostructures for Lockheed Martin, will operate the new MRO centre. Last week, their joint venture, Tata Lockheed Martin Aerostructures Ltd (TLMAL), delivered its 250th C-130J tail, a milestone in the US–India defence partnership. The new facility will join Lockheed Martin’s global network of Certified Service Centres and will eventually support the C-130J Super Hercules, KC-130J and legacy C-130 B–H variants. Rod McLean, Vice President and General Manager of Lockheed Martin’s Air Mobility and Maritime Missions, said the MRO centre would significantly strengthen India’s sustainment ecosystem. “This facility will bolster response time and security in the Pacific and advance sustainment capability for the global C-130J fleet,” he said, noting the aircraft’s record-setting high-altitude missions at Daulat Beg Oldi and Nayoma Air Base.

He argued that while valuations are a separate discussion, the technology itself is transformative. Kalra outlined a multi-tiered view of the AI ecosystem's beneficiaries. In the short to medium term, he identified chip manufacturers like Nvidia, AMD, and Google, along with ecosystem supporters like Broadcom, as the 'biggest gainers.' He noted their strong order books, which are filled for the next one to two years, are a testament to the immense investment in data centre infrastructure. For hyperscalers such as Microsoft, Google, and AWS, Kalra pointed out that while they are investing hundreds of billions in capital expenditure, they are also actively monetising this through AI cloud services, developer tools, and co-pilots, creating real revenue and profitability. For technology services companies like Persistent Systems, Kalra sees them as 'winners in the longer run.' He argued that possessing the technology is only one part of the equation. The real value for enterprises lies in integrating AI into their specific contexts, building new business use cases, and developing new business models, all of which require significant system integration activity. Currently, he said many enterprises are in the initial stages, focusing on getting their data ready for AI consumption, a space where Persistent is already seeing larger programs. Looking ahead, Kalra projected a significant revenue shift for the IT services industry. While AI-related projects may currently account for single-digit revenue, he forecasts that in three to five years, AI-native work could constitute '30 to 40% or more' of revenues for such companies. He clarified that this is a multi-year journey, not a short-term projection for the next few quarters. He also touched upon 'agentic AI' as a more advanced stage that is still in its infancy and will require robust, enterprise-wide data integration. When asked about the impact of the depreciating Indian rupee, Kalra acknowledged that there would be a short-term currency impact. However, he downplayed its overall significance, calling it a 'smaller enabler' for the industry. He emphasised that the Indian IT industry's success is built on more than just currency fluctuations. Kalra pivoted back to his central theme, stating that the most critical factor for the next three to five years is for companies to build strong capabilities in AI, which he believes will provide a 'significant amount of tailwind' for the industry. He declined to offer specific forward-looking guidance on margins, citing the company's silent period during the quarter.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/persistent-systems-ceo-says-ai-not-a-bubble-chipmakers-in-a-supercycle-outlines-long-term-growth-path-alpha-article-13714753.html
14,Business,"Citi's Drew Petti outlines overweight stance on China, Korea and neutral view on India","December 08, 2025 / 13:40 IST","With the US Federal Reserve's next policy meeting on the horizon, the market has largely priced in a 25 basis point rate cut, but the key focus remains on the path of future cuts and the resilience of the US economy. Speaking with CNBC TV18, Drew Pettit, Director of US Equity Strategy ETF Analysis Strategy Research at Citi, outlined his firm's global market strategy, highlighting an overweight position on select emerging markets and a neutral stance on India. Pettit noted that while a rate cut in the upcoming meeting is expected, the more critical factor for markets is the trajectory of monetary policy into the next year. ""Our economists and team expect 25 basis points, I believe at the next four meetings after December,"" he stated. The central question, according to Pettit, is whether these cuts will be accompanied by economic weakness or if the US economy will remain resilient. A scenario where the economy holds up despite rate cuts would signify a ""soft landing,"" which could broaden market participation beyond mega-cap growth stocks into cyclical sectors where earnings growth might improve. Looking at the S&P 500, which has already seen a 12% gain year-to-date, Pettit believes strong sentiment is likely to persist through the typically low-volume end-of-year trading period. He suggested that the index could close the year somewhere between 6,600 and 7,000, potentially threatening Citi's bull case scenario of 7,000. Contrary to some assumptions, Pettit clarified that Citi's global strategy is currently overweight on Emerging Markets (EM). This is complemented by an overweight position on Europe (excluding the UK) as a cyclical play with potential for inflecting growth. However, the primary engine for their EM preference is the opportunity to gain exposure to growth and Artificial Intelligence (AI) at a reasonable valuation. ""EM is actually a way to get growth and AI exposure at a pretty reasonable price, and we lead the overweight in EM with China and South Korea,"" Pettit explained. He pointed to companies like Alibaba, Tencent, SK Hynix, and Samsung as examples of firms that screen well in their ""AI at a reasonable price"" basket. Regarding India, Citi maintains a ""neutral"" stance. While acknowledging the strong and unchanged growth narrative, Pettit believes the positive outlook is already reflected in the country's valuations. ""You have priced in a really good earnings and growth backdrop for India, so it remains neutral to us,"" he said. He also touched upon India's significant underperformance relative to the broader EM basket this year, attributing it partly to currency weakness, which he links to perceived tariff risks. He noted that for global macro traders, the currency often acts as the first ""relief valve"" for such concerns.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/citi-s-drew-petti-outlines-overweight-stance-on-china-korea-and-neutral-view-on-india-alpha-article-13714698.html

The airport authority urged travellers to verify their flight status before leaving for the terminal, noting that schedules remain unstable as the airline works to restore normal operations. Passenger Advisory issued at 06:30 Hours#DelhiAirport#PassengerAdvisory#DELAdvisorypic.twitter.com/hrpGxn7Oxr — Delhi Airport (@DelhiAirport) December 8, 2025 “IndiGo flights may continue to experience delays. Passengers are advised to check the latest flight status with their airline before heading to the airport to avoid any circumstances,” the advisory said. IndiGo’s nationwide operational crisis has continued to ripple across India, with thousands of passengers still facing cancellations, delays, missing baggage and pending refunds. Over six days, the airline cancelled more than 2,000 domestic and international flights, triggering widespread chaos at major airports. The airline said it has so far processed Rs 610 crore in refunds and delivered around 3,000 pieces of delayed baggage. On Sunday, IndiGo operated about 1,650 of its scheduled 2,300 flights, while roughly 650 remained cancelled. The carrier has announced automatic refunds for cancelled bookings and waived change and cancellation fees for travel between December 5 and 15. Meanwhile, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has granted a one-time 24-hour extension to IndiGo’s Accountable Manager and CEO to reply to the show-cause notice issued on December 6 over large-scale disruptions and alleged non-compliances. The officials sought additional time citing operational constraints linked to the scale of the airline’s network and multiple factors behind the disruptions. After reviewing the request, the DGCA extended the deadline only until 6 pm on December 8 and warned that no further extensions would be granted. Failure to submit a comprehensive response, the regulator said, would result in the case being decided ex parte. The show-cause notice, issued to CEO Pieter Elbers, accused the airline of “significant lapses in planning, oversight and resource management” and a failure to adequately prepare for new Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) norms. The DGCA said this amounted to prima facie non-compliance with the Aircraft Rules, 1937, and related crew duty and rest regulations. The regulator also flagged shortcomings in passenger care, noting that IndiGo did not provide mandatory assistance to those affected by cancellations and delays, in violation of passenger rights norms. As disruptions persisted on Sunday, over 400 flights were cancelled, IndiGo said it expects to stabilise operations by December 10. CEO Pieter Elbers said the airline is “recovering from the disruption” and plans to operate around 1,650 flights as it adapts to the impact of the revised FDTL rules. Major hubs, including Hyderabad, Kolkata and Delhi, saw the highest cancellations as thousands of passengers remained stranded or awaiting refunds.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/indigo-flight-chaos-to-persist-today-warns-delhi-airport-amid-slow-operational-recovery-13714589.html

17,Business,"Bajaj Finserv sets sight on Rs 21,000–24,000 crore profit by FY30","December 08, 2025 / 11:41 IST","Bajaj Finserv has unveiled a bold long-range plan for 2026–2030, targeting a consolidated profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 21,000–Rs 24,000 crore by FY30, implying an 18–22 per cent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from current levels. According to a presentation made by Sanjiv Bajaj, Chairman and Managing Director, at BFS’ “Investor Day 2025” conference, this translates into the company’s consolidated assets rising to Rs 3.1–3.4 lakh crore by FY30, up from Rs 1.30 lakh crore in FY2025. It is also targeting over 220 million active customers from over 100 million now. These targets reflect a broader ambition, according to the presentation: to evolve from being a collection of standalone financial businesses into a truly integrated “financial services supermarket,” covering lending, insurance (life & general), wealth/asset management, and newer verticals, all under the Bajaj Finserv umbrella. A key enabler of this long-term goal, according to Bajaj, is the planned full acquisition of the insurance ventures. In March 2025, Bajaj Finserv signed agreements with Allianz SE to acquire its 26 percent stake each in the group’s life and general insurance joint ventures -- Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company (BALIC) and Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company (BAGIC) -- for Rs 24,180 crore. This transaction is expected to be completed by the early next calendar year. The divestment will give Bajaj Finserv “full control” over the insurance businesses, enabling the group to explore new strategic lines that were previously harder to pursue under a partnership structure. According to Bajaj, this opens up opportunities such as targeting NRIs via financial services in GIFT City, entering pension-fund management. Through GIFT City channels, GCC structures, and GN partnerships, Bajaj Finserv aims to extend its insurance-led ecosystem beyond India, especially into markets where motor, health and claims infrastructure remain fragmented or inefficient. By becoming a 100 percent owner, Bajaj Finserv expects to unlock synergies across businesses, aligning insurance, lending, wealth, and new financial services under one cohesive group strategy. Bajaj said he expects to evaluate a possible listing of at least some of the insurance arms within a 4–5 year window, meaning listing could happen as early as 2028 or slightly later. Bajaj Finserv also simultaneously plans a significant strategic reset across its insurance businesses as it prepares for full ownership following Allianz’s exit. The company will withdraw from loss-making geographies, wind down manpower-heavy distribution models, and scale back underperforming Insurance Marketing Distributors (IMDs). Instead, the focus will shift toward profitable segments such as commercial lines, high-margin protection-led life insurance, disciplined motor and health underwriting, and products with strong persistency and long-term value. This reorientation is aimed at improving combined ratios and creating a more stable, predictable earnings base for the insurance verticals, the presentation said. A major overhaul of the distribution architecture is also underway. Bajaj Finserv plans to pivot toward low-cost, scalable channels by expanding its agent and bancassurance networks, building Global Capability Centres (GCCs) for cross-border operations, and establishing Global Network (GN) partnerships to support international expansion. Digital channels will play a larger role, with deeper integration across the group’s ecosystem and its 16 crore–plus retail customer base. The company aims to leverage this vast pool of customer data to enable more refined segmentation, personalised offerings, and higher cross-sell penetration across insurance, health, and wealth products. Product innovation will form another key pillar of the strategy. The insurance businesses will integrate more closely with the group’s health and digital platforms, enabling bundled offerings that combine health services with insurance, hybrid protection-health products, SME-focused commercial insurance solutions, and future-ready pension-linked or annuity products once full consolidation is complete. These moves are intended to strengthen differentiation, widen customer reach and deepen engagement. In addition to the above, Bajaj Finserv plans to scale AI-driven underwriting, fraud detection, claims automation, particularly in motor and health, persistency analytics, and agent productivity tools. The group, according to the presentation, envisions a diversified “financial supermarket” spanning life and general insurance, lending, health and wellness services, asset and wealth management, digital financial marketplaces, alternative investment platforms, and pension and retirement solutions. Bajaj Finserv’s ambitious FY30 targets rest on its FY25 performance, according to the company’s Investor Day presentation, where its full-year consolidated income stood at Rs 1,33,822 crore, while consolidated profit after tax came in at Rs 8,872 crore. Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance reported an annual premium equivalent (APE) of Rs 6,317 crore and a value of new business (VNB) of Rs 1,152 crore, supported by strong growth in protection and annuity segments. Bajaj Allianz General Insurance recorded a gross written premium (GWP) of Rs 21,847 crore. Among emerging businesses, Bajaj Finserv Health Ltd., following its integration with Vidal Healthcare, posted Rs 892 crore in consolidated revenue. Meanwhile, Bajaj Finserv Direct Ltd., the group’s digital marketplace and services arm, turned “cash positive.” On the investments side, Bajaj Finserv Asset Management Ltd. (BFS AMC), launched only a few years ago, reported an AUM of Rs 20,365 crore as on March 31, 2025.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/bajaj-finserv-sets-sight-on-rs-21-000-24-000-crore-profit-by-fy30-13715065.html

The maiden issue of the popular mattress-maker has been subscribed 7 percent on Day 1 so far. The IPO received bids for nearly 27 lakh shares, as against an offer size of 3.63 crore shares, according to data on NSE at 11.30 am. Retail investors have booked 35 percent of their reserved portion, while Non Institutional Investors (NII) have subscribed 3 percent of the portion kept for them. Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIB) are yet to make any substantial bid for the IPO. Ahead of listing, the unlisted shares of the company were trading with 18.46 percent grey market premium (GMP) over the IPO price, according to data on Investorgain and IPO Watch. The grey market estimates signal towards a decent listing for the company. However, it is important to note that grey market is an unofficial market, and the actual listing may be significantly different from estimates. Wakefit Innovations launched its IPO to raise Rs 1,289 crore through a fresh issue of shares worth Rs 377 crore and an offer for sale of up to 4.7 crore shares worth Rs 912 crore. The price band for the IPO has been set at Rs 185-195 per share. Investors can bid for a minimum of 76 shares, requiring an investment of Rs 14,820 at the upper price band, and in multiples thereafter. The IPO will remain open for public bidding between December 8 and December 10. The allotments are likely to be finalized by December 11, and the shares are scheduled to be listing on stock exchanges BSE and NSE on December 15. Wakefit Innovations is strategically positioned to capitalize on the strong growth of India’s home and furnishings industry through its vertically integrated, omnichannel business model and extensive product portfolio spanning mattresses, furniture, and home décor, said Master Capital Services. The domestic brokerage noted that India’s home and furnishings market, which was valued at around Rs 3 trillion in 2024, is projected to grow to up to Rs 5.9 trillion by calendar year 2030, marking an 11-13 percent CAGR. This will be driven by organized retail expansion, online adoption, and premiumization. Master Capital Services said that within this category, India’s mattress market is projected to grow at a 10–12 percent CAGR by calendar year 2030, driven by rising awareness of sleep wellness and demand for branded, ergonomic products. “Investors may consider the IPO as a potential long-term investment opportunity,” it said.

Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services, Bharat Dynamics, Housing & Urban Development Corporation and Prestige Estates Projects were also down as much as 5 percent. Broader market sentiment remained weak, mirroring declines in the Sensex and Nifty as investors turned cautious ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s policy meeting and continued foreign fund outflows.

20,Business,Govt to likely offload 1–2% LIC stake via offer for sale route in Q4FY26,"December 08, 2025 / 13:22 IST","The government is examining a proposal to offload 1–2 percent stake in Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) through an offer for sale (OFS) in the fourth quarter (Q4) of the current financial year (FY26), with government sources citing the insurer’s large market capitalisation and subdued investor appetite as key considerations. A senior government source told Moneycontrol that the size of the LIC counter makes a larger sale difficult in the current environment. Earlier, government discussions had pointed to a larger 2.5–3 percent stake sale through an OFS. However, sources said current market conditions and muted investor appetite have prompted a revision to a smaller 1–2 percent tranche to ensure a successful execution. “A 1–2 percent LIC OFS is feasible and should fetch roughly Rs 13,000–14,000 crore. At this stage, there is simply no appetite for a 3 percent sale, which would be nearly Rs 24,000 crore,” the source said, adding that the sale is being aligned with broader market conditions. The official also noted that the government is watching global volatility, domestic flows, and institutional absorption capacity, before taking a final decision. “We are preparing for Q4, but the exact window will depend on how markets behave over the next several weeks,” the person added. If carried out, this would mark the first dilution of the Centre’s stake in LIC since the insurer’s landmark 2022 initial public offering (IPO). Since then, the government has not sold any further stake in the state-owned insurer. The government currently holds a 96.5 percent stake in LIC. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) requires listed companies to have a 25 percent public shareholding, but granted LIC a special extension, allowing it until May 16, 2027, to reach a minimum 10 percent public stake, as it currently stands at 3.5 percent, post-IPO. This temporary 10 percent goal, set by Sebi's extension, is part of a longer, one-time exemption for LIC to eventually meet the full 25 percent norm by 2032. Investor activity in the broader market has seen a notable shift, especially among retail participants. Retail investors have offloaded over Rs 25,300 crore in equities in October–November 2025, driven by heightened volatility, profit-booking, and a preference for safer assets, even as domestic institutional investors and mutual funds continued to record net buying. This sharp reversal in retail flows has added to the government’s caution in timing the LIC OFS. Sources believe a staggered approach could prevent oversupply while still helping the government advance towards its disinvestment goals. “Investor sentiment has been fragile, particularly on the retail side. That is why a smaller tranche is safer and more practical in the current environment,” he said. Sources said a smaller, price-sensitive OFS could receive strong institutional demand, particularly from domestic funds, given the insurer’s weight in benchmark indices and its steady earnings profile. However, sustained global uncertainty and oil prices may keep foreign institutional investors cautious. The LIC counter, with a market capitalisation of roughly Rs 6 lakh crore, is among the largest PSU stocks. Any stake sale – particularly of this size – has the potential to influence market liquidity, index weightings, and short-term price movement. Given the government’s majority holding, periodic stake dilution is important for improving free float and enhancing long-term institutional participation. An offer for-sale is a mechanism through which promoters can sell shares to the public via the stock exchanges. The price is discovered through a bidding window typically open for a day. Retail investors may be allotted a portion at a discount, depending on the structure of the issue. OFS transactions help the government meet minimum public shareholding norms and raise funds without undertaking a full-fledged follow-on offer.

23,Business,IndiGo shares tumble 10%: Brokerages see costs rising for airline as FDTL norms trigger mass flight cancellations,"December 08, 2025 / 13:33 IST","The shares of InterGlobe Aviation, the parent company of IndiGo, crashed nearly 10 percent on December 8, extending losses for the seventh consecutive session. Brokerages have cautioned investors, with some reducing their target prices for the stock as the airline continues to face massive disruptions. The shares of the company were trading at Rs 4,842.50 apiece in the afternoon hours of Monday, the lowest level seen by the stock in seven months. IndiGo’s flight cancellations continued to persist on Monday, leading to widespread chaos at India's major airports. Delhi airport issued an advisory in the early hours of the day, stating that schedules remain unstable as the airline works to restore normal operations. Over six days, the airline cancelled more than 2,000 domestic and international flights. Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has sent a show-cause notice to IndiGo CEO Peter Elbers over large-scale disruptions and alleged non-compliances. The show-cause notice, issued to CEO Pieter Elbers, accused the airline of “significant lapses in planning, oversight and resource management” and a failure to adequately prepare for new Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) norms. A significant factor behind the chaos is a sharp shortage of crew, particularly pilots, following the introduction of revised Flight Duty Time Limitation (FDTL) norms last month. The new rules mandate more rest hours and humane rosters, but IndiGo has been struggling to realign its network accordingly. Union Civil Aviation Minister Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu today said that the IndiGo crisis was driven by problems in its crew rostering and internal planning system. Addressing the Rajya Sabha, Naidu said that strict Civil Aviation Requirements (CARs) are in place for passengers who have faced difficulties due to delays and cancellations. ""I want more players in the industry. Today, India has a capacity of five big airlines and there has been an effort from the ministry to encourage more airlines,"" he added. UBS kept its 'Buy' call on the shares of IndiGo, but reduced its target price for the stock to Rs 6,350 per share. This implies an upside potential of more than 18 percent from the stock's previous closing price. The international brokerage said that inadequate preparations for the revised FDTL norms have led to major disruptions. It raised cost estimates for FY26-FY28 to account for the additional crew required to comply with the FDTL norms and higher operational costs driven by rupee depreciation against the dollar. IndiGo's long-term growth outlook however remains robust, supported by its international expansion, UBS said. It added that the key downside risks include any contingent costs arising from operational disruptions and further depreciation. Jefferies kept a 'Buy' call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 7,025 per share. This implies an upside potential of nearly 31 percent from the stock's previous closing price. The international brokerage noted that the company has been hit the hardest by the new FDTL norms, which reduce pilot duty hours and increases crew requirements. It noted that the rule change coincided with IndiGo’s capacity expansion, technical issues and congestion, triggering cascading disruptions. Airline is now recalibrating schedules and expects normalcy by mid-December, Jefferies noted, adding that IndiGo will face rising costs from disruptions and higher crew expenses. JM Financial kept a 'Reduce' call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 5,570 apiece. This implies an upside potential of around 4 percent from the stock's previous closing price. The domestic brokerage said that recent mismanagement leading to significant flight cancellations is largely a function of new FDTL norms impact kicking in immediately post Airbus software upgrade challenges. ""The recent incident is likely to lead to a higher CAGR in CASK ex-fuel-ex-forex in future years subject to regulatory actions,"" it said. JM Financial noted that the show-cause notice sent to the CEO is likely to further dampen stock performance besides possible impending one-time penalty. “Near-term, we estimate earnings hit of 8-9% for FY26 if the situation lasts for a total of ~15 days. We await further clarity to revise our earnings estimates, given it’s a developing situation. Even as the FY26 earnings hit has been priced in, the stock is yet to price in 1) structural cost increase driven by regulatory actions 2) one time penalty 3) management change if any,” it added. IndiGo shares have fallen more than 13 percent in the past five days, and around 10 percent in the past one month. The shares of the airline have fallen more than 12 percent in the past six months, but are up nearly 9 percent in 2025 so far. The stock's P/E ratio currently stands at around 31.

24,Business,"Biocon merger is earnings dilutive, avoid EMS sector for now, says Dharmesh Kant","December 08, 2025 / 13:53 IST","Market expert Dharmesh Kant has voiced a cautious outlook on Biocon following its recent merger, and has recommended avoiding the electronics manufacturing services (EMS) sector for the time being. Speaking with CNBC TV18, Dharmesh Kant, Head Research at Chola Securities, said that while the street may have anticipated the move to make Biocon Biologics a 100% subsidiary, the deal is likely to be dilutive to earnings per share (EPS). Delving into the Biocon deal, Kant pointed out that the company has historically been 'over-hyped', with its performance not always matching expectations. He highlighted that over the last decade, Biocon's profitability growth has been modest, at around 9-10%, while its return on equity (ROE) has remained in the mid-single digits. He believes the current merger is not value accretive. ""With this merger coming into play, it's not that it's value accretive or EPS accretive, I think it's EPS dilutive,"" he stated. The dilution is expected to come from two primary sources: the upcoming qualified institutional placement (QIP) and an increased debt burden that will lead to higher expenses. According to his analysis, it could take a year to a year and a half for the synergies from the merger to fully materialise. He also suggested that the company pursued this route to prevent 'value dilution' that might have occurred with an initial public offering (IPO). Consequently, Kant anticipates a correction in Biocon's stock, which he believes could persist for about a year until the company demonstrates a return to a double-digit growth trajectory. Shifting focus to the EMS space, the expert addressed the recent pressure on stocks like Kaynes Technology and PG Electroplast. He clarified that the issue is not isolated but rather a sector-wide phenomenon. ""There has been a deceleration in the entire EMS space that we have seen, be it PG Electroplast or the others in the play like Kaynes, Dixon, Amber. Everybody is facing the heat of decelerating business growth trajectory,"" he observed. Two major headwinds for the sector are uncomfortable valuations, which he described as 'pretty high', and the prospect of intensifying competition. He specifically mentioned the potential for increased competition from Larsen & Toubro (L&T) as it plans a significant foray into the EMS market in the coming years. For PG Electroplast in particular, a significant factor is the pending approval for a technology transfer tie-up with a Chinese firm for air conditioner compressor technology. He noted that if this permission is granted, it could be a 'different story' for the company, as this technology is currently elusive for Indian manufacturers. However, pending this development, his overall call for the EMS sector is one of avoidance. He suggested that while some stocks might see a bounce-back, it would likely be a temporary rebound rather than a structural recovery, advising investors to stay away from the space for some time.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/biocon-merger-is-earnings-dilutive-avoid-ems-sector-for-now-says-dharmesh-kant-alpha-article-13714752.html

He was speaking during an exclusive interaction with Moneycontrol at the AMC’s bumper IPO launch. The issue will be a 100 percent OFS of up to 9.91 percent of the equity share capital. ICICI Prudential AMC is a joint venture of ICICI Bank and Prudential Corporation Holdings Limited. It is currently the second-largest AMC by AUM and the sixth AMC to go public. The price band has been fixed at Rs 2,061–2,165 per share, valuing the company at around Rs 10,600 crore at the top end. The issue will open on December 12 and close on December 16. Speaking about the SIF category, Shah said SEBI “has thought through the SIF category very well,” adding that the segment holds significant long-term promise. However, he cautioned against expecting immediate scale. “It will happen. I don’t expect that something will happen in 6 months, 1 year,” he noted. Currently, around four mutual funds have launched SIF products, including Edelweiss Mutual Fund, SBI Mutual Fund, ITI AMC and Quant AMC, among others. ICICI Prudential AMC currently has a 13.2 percent market share and reported a profit of Rs 1,618 crore and revenue of Rs 2,949 crore in the six months ended September 2025—up 21.9 percent and 20 percent respectively from a year earlier. For the financial year ended March 2025, profit rose 29.3 percent to Rs 2,651 crore, while revenue surged 32.4 percent to Rs 4,977 crore.

26,Business,MC EXCLUSIVE      India is an infinite market at the right price: ICICI Pru AMC's Nimesh Shah bets on scale over margins,"December 08, 2025 / 13:51 IST","If you can deliver a low-cost product to India’s middle class, the market is “infinite,” says ICICI Prudential AMC Managing Director and CEO Nimesh Shah — and that is why he is relaxed about margins even as the fund house prepares for its blockbuster IPO. Shah said the core growth driver for both the industry and his firm will remain customer experience, not pricing power. “If you can deliver a product with minimum margins to the middle class of the country, the market is infinite, that's how I look at it,” he told Moneycontrol in an exclusive interaction on the sidelines of the IPO launch, which opens on December 12. He argued that in India, asset management is fundamentally a volume business. “In this business one should not worry about margin, one should worry about volume,” he said. Lower fees, he added, strengthen the proposition rather than dilute it. “If I am charging less, my probability of meeting benchmark is higher. So, business is more sustainable,” he said. Shah acknowledged that ICICI Prudential AMC’s operating margins have stayed flat to slightly lower over the past two to three years, even as assets under management have risen sharply. But he said overall profitability has kept growing, helped by strong industry-wide sales momentum and steady investor flows. “Look at my profit growth over the last three years and see my margins have been dropping all three years, and still I am okay,” he said. He credited much of the industry’s expansion to regulation and investor experience. SEBI, he said, has ensured that mutual funds remain “very pure and transparent for the final investor,” while performance has done the rest. “In this business you can get money only if the past experience of the customer is good,” he said. That experience, he noted, has been shaped by the rise of SIPs and the way investors behaved in recent corrections. “When the markets corrected, the SIPs didn’t stop. When the markets corrected, more money came into the market,” he said, calling it evidence of how the Indian investor has evolved. A key element of ICICI Prudential’s strategy, Shah said, is recognising that “the customer is always pro-cyclical” while successful investing requires a counter-cyclical approach. He pointed to the AMC’s dynamic asset allocation and balanced advantage products, which he described as being designed to work against prevailing market emotion. “When the customer is selling, the fund is buying. When the markets are going up, the fund is actually selling,” he said, adding that the category has been built out over many years and now commands more than 25 percent market share in asset allocation products. On the margin debate, Shah underlined that the reported number is an aggregate of very different businesses. ICICI Prudential runs “five different businesses with five different margins” — liquid funds, overnight funds, equity funds, hybrid funds and others. “What margins you see is a mix of all these funds. And these all are different businesses,” he said. Liquid and overnight categories, largely institutional, naturally run at lower margins than equity and hybrid segments focused on individual investors. “What you see as a margin is a cocktail of all of this put together,” he said. Asked whether current margin levels can be maintained, Shah said no chief executive can forecast that with certainty because it depends on market conditions and growth across segments. “You make your assumptions how much will liquid grow, how much will equity grow. I am positioned. In each business I have got a good market share. I am focused on a profitable growth in every business of mine. What you see is an outcome,” he said. ICICI Prudential AMC’s IPO will be a 100 percent offer for sale, comprising up to 9.91 percent of the company’s equity share capital. The fund house — a joint venture between ICICI Bank and Prudential Corporation Holdings — will become the sixth AMC to list in India. The price band is set at ₹2,061–2,165 per share, valuing the company at around ₹10,600 crore at the top end. The issue opens on December 12 and closes on December 16. Financially, the AMC has delivered strong momentum ahead of its listing. It reported ₹1,618 crore in profit and ₹2,949 crore in revenue in the six months ended September 2025, marking year-on-year growth of 21.9 percent and 20 percent, respectively. For FY25, profit rose 29.3 percent to ₹2,651 crore, while revenue increased 32.4 percent to ₹4,977 crore.

27,Markets,"Copper climbs to record as China policy, US imports spur rally","December 08, 2025 / 13:17 IST","Copper rose to an all-time high after China set domestic growth as its top economic priority for next year, and amid stockpiling of the metal in the US. The industrial metal climbed as much as 1.3% to $11,771 a ton, blazing past a record set in the previous session. The latest spike came after Beijing said on Monday it would stick with a “more proactive” fiscal approach and maintain a “moderately loose” monetary stance for the world’s second-largest economy. “The Politburo readouts present a more proactive macro environment than investors have expected,” said Xu Wanqiu, an analyst with Chinese brokerage Cofco Futures Co.. “Copper will benefit from policy support toward power-grid upgrades, computing power. The momentum remains very bullish,” she said. Trade data from China was also supportive, with exports rebounding last month to beat estimates and push the country’s trade surplus past $1 trillion for the first time in any year. Copper – a metal critical for electrification and the energy transition – has gained more than 30% on the London Metal Exchange this year. New demand fueled by data centers and electric vehicles has come up against tight global supply, with smelting capacity growing faster than mines can keep up. A series of mine outages has exacerbated a shortage of raw materials. The rally has accelerated in recent weeks on concerns over an exodus of the metal to the US in anticipation that President Donald Trump will impose tariffs next year. This has squeezed inventories and sent premiums elsewhere to unprecedented highs, while also causing futures in New York to spike above those on the LME. Global supply of refined copper could see a shortfall of 450,000 tons in 2026, partly due to this stockpiling in America, analysts from Chinese brokerage Citic Securities Co. said in a note. Prices must average above $12,000 a ton next year to attract the investment needed in new mining capacity to ensure sufficient supply in the medium- to long-term, the Citic analysts, led by Ao Chong, said. Copper was up 0.8% at $11,713 a ton on the LME as of 7:18 a.m in London.

28,Markets,Goa nightclub blaze: CM Sawant drops major clue on what sparked it,"December 08, 2025 / 11:11 IST","The Goa nightclub tragedy that claimed 25 lives may have been sparked by “electric firecrackers” set off inside the packed venue, Chief Minister Pramod Sawant has said, citing a preliminary inquiry. The North Goa club, Birch by Romeo Lane in Arpora, was bustling with weekend crowds when a massive fire ripped through it around 11.45 pm on Saturday. The blaze exposed layers of illegalities, rule violations, and official complacency that allowed the establishment to operate without even a fire department NOC, according to officials quoted by PTI. Sawant said early findings point to the use of electric firecrackers inside the premises. Most victims died of suffocation after getting trapped on the ground floor and in the kitchen. Firefighters said narrow lanes blocked their vehicles, forcing water tankers to halt nearly 400 metres away. Small exits and a narrow bridge made escape even harder. The fire killed 20 staff members and five tourists, including four from Delhi. Many workers were from Uttarakhand, Jharkhand, Assam, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Nepal. Police have arrested four managers of the club, while an FIR has been registered against owners Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra and the event organisers. Three senior government officials have been suspended for clearing the nightclub’s operations in 2023 despite violations. Eyewitnesses told PTI the fire may have first erupted on the first floor where tourists were dancing. One survivor, Riya from Delhi, said firecrackers burst around dancers shortly before flames swept through the club, causing panic and a stampede-like situation. Another survivor, Fatima Shaikh from Hyderabad, said people ran downstairs into the kitchen, where many eventually got trapped. Temporary structures made of palm leaves caught fire within moments, turning the space into an inferno. The state government has announced Rs five lakh ex-gratia for the families of each victim and Rs 50,000 for the injured. Arrangements are being made to send the bodies to their home states. Sawant said an audit of all clubs operating without permission or with high footfall will now be undertaken. *With PTI inputs",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/goa-nightclub-blaze-cm-sawant-drops-major-clue-on-what-sparked-it-13714730.html

The shares dropped to Rs 403.20 apiece on Monday. The stock has made only marginal gains over its IPO price in the first one month since listing. Around 4.07 crore shares or 2 percent of the company's stake will free up for trade as the lock-in comes to an end today, CNBC-TV18 quoted Nuvama Alternative & Quantitative Research as saying. The said number of shares will be cumulatively worth around Rs 1,700 crore based on the stock's previous closing price of Rs 417.20 per share. However, this does not imply that all these shares will be offloaded in the market immediately. The expiry of the lock-in period simply means that these shares can now be traded. Lenskart shares are currently up only 0.3 percent from the IPO price of Rs 403.2 apiece, and more than 2 percent from its listing price of Rs 395 per share on NSE. The stock had listed with a discount on stock markets on November 10. This came despite the Rs 7,278-crore IPO seeing strong investor interest during its three days of public bidding, being subscribed more than 28 times its offer size. After listing, the stock rose nearly 14 percent to hit a high of Rs 448.80 apiece on December 1. However, the shares of the popular eyewear-retailer have now fallen nearly 10 percent since then. Lenskart in November reported a net profit of Rs 103.5 crore for the second quarter of the financial year 2026. This marked a 20 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase from the Rs 86.3 crore net profit reported in the same period of the previous financial year.

The persistent foreign fund outflows also dented the investor mood amid caution ahead of US Fed outcome on Wednesday. At around 1:35 p.m., the Sensex fell 802.91 points or 0.94 percent to 84,909.45, while the broader Nifty declined to 25,917.40, down 269.05 points or 1.03 percent. InterGlobe Aviation, Bharat Electronics and ETERNAL were among the major laggards in the Nifty50 pack, declining up to 7 percent, while HDFC Life Insurance Company and Tech Mahindra were among the major gainers, rising up to 1 percent. Market breadth remained negative as about 1174 shares advanced, 2418 shares declined and 201 shares unchanged. 1) Caution ahead of US Fed meet: The investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of the Fed’s two-day meeting beginning December 9. ""Investors positioned cautiously ahead of the upcoming FOMC meeting, additional inflation releases, and year-end portfolio adjustments,"" said Devarsh Vakil, Head of Prime Research, HDFC Securities. He added that central banks in Australia, Brazil, Canada and Switzerland are also scheduled to meet this week, though no policy changes are expected outside the Fed. 2) Heavy selling in small and midcap shares: The small- and mid-cap shares came under sharp selling pressure on Monday as investors booked profits, dragging several stocks down. The Nifty Smallcap100 index declined for the fifth straight session, slipping over 2 percent in intra-day trade. The index has fallen more than 4 percent over the past five sessions. The Nifty Midcap100 index also slipped about 2 percent. ""Initially the fall was largely restricted to the midcap and smallcap names and it now cascading to the largecap also. Seems like profit taking in them after seeing the carnage in broader markets, said Ajit Mishra, SVP, Research, Religare Broking Ltd. 3) Persistent FII outflows: Foreign institutional investors extended their selling streak, offloading equities worth Rs 438.90 crore on Friday — the seventh straight session of net outflows. Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director at Vibhavangal Anukulakara, noted ""The​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ fall is mainly due to a nervous worldwide atmosphere. There is uncertainty about when the rate cuts will happen and that the Asian markets are weak. Following the strong rally of recent days, valuations had become a bit stretched, which made the indices more vulnerable to negative cues. The force of the fall in the midcap and smallcap segments is greater, these areas having been driven up more quickly and usually reacting sharply during times of liquidity tightening or ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌profit-booking."" 4) Weak rupee: The rupee weakened 16 paise to 90.11 against the US dollar in early trade, weighed down by higher crude prices and continued foreign fund withdrawals. The local currency opened at 90.07 before easing further on strong dollar demand from corporates, importers and overseas portfolio investors, forex dealers said. 5) Crude rises: Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, inched up 0.13 percent to USD 63.83 per barrel. Higher crude prices tend to pressure India’s import bill and fuel inflation concerns, often prompting cautious sentiment in the equity market. 6) India Vix rises: India VIX, the volatility index, rose 2.11 percent to 10.53. A higher VIX indicates increased market uncertainty, which typically leads traders to reduce risk exposure. Vakil said the Nifty regained its upward momentum after moving above its near-term resistance at 26,100 on Friday. ""Immediate resistance is now seen around 26,300, followed by 26,500, while on the downside, the 25,950–26,000 band is expected to act as a crucial support zone,"" he added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-slips-300-pts-nifty-below-26-100-caution-ahead-of-fed-meet-among-key-factors-behind-market-decline-13714895.html

Retail investors have booked 41 percent of their reserved portion, while Non-Institutional Investors (NII) have subscribed 28 percent of their allotted quota. Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIB) are yet to make any substantial bid for the IPO.

Corona Remedies launched its IPO today to raise more than Rs 655 crore through an entirely offer for sale (OFS) of shares with no fresh issue component. This means that all of the IPO proceeds will go the selling investors and not the company. The price band for the IPO has been set at Rs 1,008-1,062 per share.

The shares were traded at Rs 290.4 apiece, valuing the deal at roughly Rs 1,535 crore, according to exchange data. The block deal was executed at a slight discount of about 0.7 percent to Friday’s close of Rs 292.4. Following the block deal, Eternal (Zomato) shares slipped into red, giving up early morning gains, and were quoting at Rs 289, down 1.1 percent on the NSE at about 10.30 am. The stock is up 4.6 percent so far this year, with the company's market capitalisation at over Rs 2.6 lakh crore. The block deal comes after the news reports about the impending development, flagging an institutional investor’s plan to offload up to 0.5 percent equity at a floor price of Rs 289.5 a share. Eternal has witnessed several large trades this year: two block deals in mid-November involved nearly 90 lakh shares worth Rs 279.25 crore, while another 60.93 lakh shares exchanged hands in June at an average Rs 256 per share, amounting to Rs 156 crore. Monday’s transaction extends a steady run of institutional activity in the counter, reflecting continued interest around Eternal following a sharp surge in its scale and ongoing developments in its quick-commerce business. The company’s consolidated net profit had declined 63 percent year-on-year to Rs 65 crore in Q2 FY26 despite revenue jumping more than 183 percent to Rs 13,590 crore, led primarily by Blinkit. Eternal has also remained in the spotlight for its recent capital support to Blinkit.

The total Rs 2,600 crore infusion in 2025 is aimed at funding Blinkit’s network expansion, managing operating losses and working-capital needs, and supporting capex, according to regulatory filings.

37,Markets,OPINION | SEBI’s New Era of Enforcement: Incentivising compliance through litigation risk,"December 08, 2025 / 10:07 IST","A subtle but material shift is underway in the Securities and Exchange Board of India's (SEBI) approach to market discipline. Observing recent regulatory actions suggest that SEBI no longer limits its enforcement strategy in case of technical violations to traditional adjudication proceedings. Instead, even technical or procedural lapses by market participants are now leading to parallel regulatory action, reflecting a more comprehensive enforcement mandate. This change marks a significant, tightening of the compliance environment. In the aftermath of several instances, where market processes failed and instances where investors were misled by intermediaries and advisers, SEBI and the stock exchanges have tightened their supervisory approach. Often, SEBI also starts parallel proceedings under the Intermediaries Regulations, where possible directions include suspension or cancellation of registration. These actions carry heavier consequences: reputational damage, loss of client trust, and impact on future business, often beyond monetary penalties. This sharper risk profile is pushing intermediaries to strengthen compliance proactively and consistently to avoid SEBI enforcement that can lead to multiple, costly litigations. While the regulator has, in certain instances, adopted a lenient view where intermediaries have taken corrective steps and settled penalties in related matters, the larger risk landscape remains deeply concerning. The pendency of intermediary proceedings can leave firms operating under a cloud of uncertainty, with expansion plans stalled, critical business approvals paused and counterparties hesitant to commit. The operational and strategic freeze that accompanies such regulatory overhang is not a theoretical risk but a very real constraint that can erode competitiveness and long-term stability. This underscores how even modest compliance lapses can trigger consequences that extend far beyond the immediate proceeding. A recent SEBI order involving Stockholding Services Limited, broking arm and wholly owned subsidiary of Stockholding Corporation of India Limited serves as a telling example of this evolving enforcement outlook. While SEBI emphasised the intermediary’s responsibility to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, SEBI opted to issue a regulatory censure - a milder enforcement action that records the lapse without imposing a penalty but may still impact the entity’s reputation and be noted in future regulatory assessments. There is also a clear trend of intermediaries and market participants choosing SEBI’s settlement mechanism to avoid prolonged litigation and reputational taint when SEBI initiates multiple proceedings. However, even for minor violations, they often end up paying significant settlement amounts, and these amounts increase when multiple proceedings are initiated. The settlement proceedings are not just limited to monetary penalty but also comes with adverse directions in certain cases as well. This experience is prompting firms to tighten their compliance frameworks upfront so they can prevent breaches and avoid settlements and related risks. The intent behind stronger supervision is not to burden intermediaries or market participants, but to ensure that procedural or substantive lapses do not ultimately affect investors. Every regulatory action, including the recent increase in scrutiny, must therefore be understood in the larger context of safeguarding market integrity and maintaining confidence among investors. Early and proactive compliance can spare intermediaries a great deal of trouble. Fixing small mistakes, the moment they surface during inspections, and letting the regulator know that the fix has been taken care of, goes a long way in reducing the risk of enforcement action. SEBI, to its credit, tends to be fair when entities show they are taking responsibility. In fact, a quick clean up often ensures that what could have become a regulatory storm ends up as nothing more than a gentle compliance drizzle. There is a noticeable shift in the market, with an increasing number of intermediaries subjected to routine inspections by the regulator and the market infrastructure institutions opting for independent legal and compliance audits by external experts. This trend is visible across entities of varying sizes and reflects a growing recognition that early identification of gaps is critical for reducing the likelihood of enforcement action. Compliance with the law is the best shield against enforcement actions and litigation. As SEBI enters a new phase of focused and consistent enforcement, market participants must recognise that following regulatory norms is not just good governance, but it is the most effective way to reduce risk. Those who comply remain largely insulated from regulatory action; it is non-compliance that invites scrutiny, penalties, and reputational damage.

39,Markets,"IndiGo shares crash 4% as flight disruptions persist; DGCA flags planning lapses, demands CEO response today","December 08, 2025 / 10:41 IST","InterGlobe Aviation shares declined on Monday as IndiGo’s nationwide operational crisis entered its seventh day, with flight delays and cancellations continuing to disrupt schedules across major airports. InterGlobe Aviation (IndiGo) stock fell 4 percent to Rs 5,154 in the morning trade, even as the airline worked to stabilise operations amid regulatory scrutiny and passenger complaints. Delhi airport issued an early-morning advisory cautioning travellers that IndiGo disruptions were likely through the day, urging them to check flight status before heading to the terminal. The warning came after IndiGo cancelled more than 2,000 flights over six days, triggering widespread chaos, missing baggage, and refund delays for thousands of passengers. On Sunday, the carrier operated about 1,650 of its scheduled 2,300 flights, while roughly 650 remained cancelled. IndiGo said it has processed Rs 610 crore in refunds and delivered around 3,000 pieces of delayed baggage. The airline has also waived change and cancellation fees for travel between December 5 and 15. Regulatory pressure intensified as the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) granted a one-time 24-hour extension to CEO Pieter Elbers to respond to a show-cause notice issued on December 6, after IndiGo officials sought more time citing operational constraints. The regulator set a final deadline of 6 pm on Monday and warned that the case would be decided ex parte if no comprehensive reply is submitted. The DGCA’s notice accused IndiGo of “significant lapses in planning, oversight and resource management”, and inadequate preparation for the new Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) norms that took effect recently. The regulator also flagged shortfalls in mandatory passenger assistance during the disruption. The crisis has its roots in a string of operational setbacks that compounded through last week. Devesh Agarwal, Chief Analyst at BangaloreAviation.com, described the cascading failures as a “death by a thousand cuts”, ranging from weather issues and an Airbus A320 software glitch to baggage belt failures and localised airport constraints. He termed the implementation of revised FDTL rules the “coup de grâce”, saying airlines had deferred compliance for years and were likely caught off guard when the DGCA declined further extensions. IndiGo has announced a 10 percent capacity reduction to stabilise its network, which Agarwal called a “tacit admission” of the challenges but a professional step to reset operations. He expects the short-term impact on InterGlobe Aviation’s share price to be negative but remains optimistic about the airline’s long-term fundamentals. Brokerage commentary last week underscored concerns about rising costs and near-term earnings pressure. Citi maintained a ‘buy’ call with a Rs 6,500 target price, while Morgan Stanley trimmed its target and cut EPS estimates for FY27 and FY28 by 20 percent, citing higher crew-related costs due to the new duty norms. InterGlobe Aviation shares have risen 12.25 percent so far this year and trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 39.02. The airline has said it expects operations to stabilise by December 10.

IndiGo’s nationwide operational crisis has continued to ripple across India, with thousands of passengers still facing cancellations, delays, missing baggage and pending refunds. Over six days, the airline cancelled more than 2,000 domestic and international flights, triggering widespread chaos at major airports. The airline said it has so far processed Rs 610 crore in refunds and delivered around 3,000 pieces of delayed baggage. On Sunday, IndiGo operated about 1,650 of its scheduled 2,300 flights, while roughly 650 remained cancelled.

The officials sought additional time citing operational constraints linked to the scale of the airline’s network and multiple factors behind the disruptions. After reviewing the request, the DGCA extended the deadline only until 6 pm on December 8 and warned that no further extensions would be granted. Failure to submit a comprehensive response, the regulator said, would result in the case being decided ex parte. The show-cause notice, issued to CEO Pieter Elbers, accused the airline of “significant lapses in planning, oversight and resource management” and a failure to adequately prepare for new Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) norms. The DGCA said this amounted to prima facie non-compliance with the Aircraft Rules, 1937, and related crew duty and rest regulations. The regulator also flagged shortcomings in passenger care, noting that IndiGo did not provide mandatory assistance to those affected by cancellations and delays, in violation of passenger rights norms. As disruptions persisted on Sunday, over 400 flights were cancelled, IndiGo said it expects to stabilise operations by December 10.

44,Markets,Sell $100 million every minute: Inside India’s rupee defence,"December 08, 2025 / 10:48 IST","India’s central bank delivers the secret instructions to dedicated rupee traders in soundproof rooms. Some days the orders focus on size: sell $100 million every minute. Other times, it’s about market levels: sell everything until the target is hit. And on certain days, the instruction is simply to step aside. The hard-to-predict intervention strategy is part of the Reserve Bank of India’s increasingly high-stakes attempt to manage the rupee as it weakens to all-time lows. Interviews with bankers, traders and former central bank officials — some of whom described on condition of anonymity how the RBI’s closely guarded interventions work — suggest volatility is likely to remain elevated, with trading punctuated by sudden swings as the central bank steps in and out of the market. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra is seeking to target speculation in the chronically weak currency while avoiding the heavy-handed intervention seen last year under his predecessor. It’s a difficult balance to get right. Too little and one-way bets can escalate, deepening the slump. Too much and the resulting rupee buying can drain liquidity from the banking system, weighing on economic growth, as well as draw down valuable foreign reserves. “Malhotra seems willing to stick to a leaning against the wind approach,” said Eswar Prasad, former head of the IMF’s China division, who is now an economics professor at Cornell University. “Not fully resisting market pressures to push the currency’s value in a particular direction but intervening at the margin to limit short-run exchange rate volatility and overshooting.” Pressure is rising. The rupee has tumbled 4.9% against the dollar in 2025, ranking behind only the Turkish lira and Argentina’s peso among 31 major currencies in terms of declines. And this is in a year when a gauge of the dollar’s strength has fallen more than 7%. A widening trade deficit, punitive 50% US tariffs on Indian goods and foreign outflows are all weighing on the rupee. A failure to nail down a deal with Washington has deepened pressure on the currency. The central bank was historically guarded about discussing its currency market interventions, but officials began acknowledging such actions more openly in the past few years. Malhotra has spoken a number of times about the need for intervention to manage volatility. An RBI spokesperson didn’t reply to an email seeking comment.  The decision over whether and how to intervene takes place every morning before markets open in the RBI’s headquarters in south Mumbai, where the Financial Markets Committee comprising officials from different departments meets to discuss various pressures on the exchange rate. If necessary they gather multiple times a day, according to a former central bank official. The governor makes the final call. Once the nod is given, the call typically goes through to senior dealers at large state-run banks, who man special desks dedicated to carrying out the RBI’s instructions. These are located in sealed rooms equipped with separate, unrecorded phone lines. The dealers aren’t given any warning by the central bank, which also doesn’t reveal the depth of the order book. To make its actions less predictable, the central bank sometimes avoids round figures and abruptly stops after selling an amount such as $217 million. The RBI may also quickly change strategy if officials think traders have worked out a pattern of intervention. Participating banks, which can include private sector lenders, are prohibited from running proprietary positions during intervention. They are only allowed to close their existing positions and manage client flows. When a senior dealer raises their hand, the other traders know it means “all hands off.” The transactions themselves aren’t particularly remunerative — the RBI pays a fee which barely covers costs. Interventions have long played an integral role in India, which has a traumatic history with rupee weakness. A balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the government to pawn gold to pay for imports as foreign reserves ran empty. In 2013, the rupee was one of the hardest hit during the so-called taper tantrum, when the US Federal Reserve announced it would start tapering quantitative easing. That prompted successive RBI governors to build up India’s foreign reserves, which stood at $686 billion — including some $557 billion in currency holdings and $106 billion in gold — as of Nov. 28. That’s among the largest in the world and enough to cover about 11 months of imports. “India has gone through episodes in the past when the currency underwent significant depreciation amid lower reserves,” said R. Gurumurthy, a former central bank official, who handled the currency desk. He declined to discuss specifics about how its operations work. “Overall, the approach toward larger intervention has evolved in line with the growing reserves — it ensures confidence.” The decision by Malhotra’s predecessor Shaktikanta Das to clamp down on price swings in the rupee prompted the IMF in December 2023 to reclassify India’s de-facto exchange rate regime from “floating” to “stabilized” — essentially a tightly managed float — triggering critcism from the RBI. Under Malhotra, who has a master’s degree in public policy from Princeton University and took over the reins a year ago, the central bank has taken a more idiosyncratic approach to intervention. The shift toward bigger two-way movements drew praise from the IMF, which loosened its classification on India’s currency management to “crawl-like” last month. The unpredictability also helps minimize speculation in the market, according to G. Mahalingam, a former executive director at the RBI who handled the financial markets department. “Yes, there will be speculators in the market, but speculators are going to come into the market with an apprehension that they’re going to get hurt very badly because they don't know how to predict the RBI,” Mahalingam said, without going into any details of how the central bank conducts interventions. Because the rupee is only partially convertible due to India’s capital controls, intervention typically requires the RBI to step in both in its domestic market as well as overseas. Internationally, the rupee is largely traded through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs) — derivatives contracts that lock in exchange rates and are settled in dollars. The RBI intervenes via the Bank for International Settlements with a few large banks acting as counterparties in round-the-clock markets operating through Singapore, Dubai and London. Successive interventions this year have helped reduce foreign currency assets by about $38 billion since this year’s high in June through Nov. 28 and drained cash from the banking system. On Friday, Malhotra said the RBI will buy bonds and conduct a foreign-exchange swap to inject the equivalent of $16 billion to ease liquidity. The central bank appears to be becoming more tolerant of depreciation. The RBI net sold an average of $1.2 billion of spot foreign currency reserves per week in the four weeks through Nov. 21, compared with weekly drainage of $3.5 billion in the preceding four weeks, Nomura Holdings Inc. estimated in a note dated Dec. 3. “Our stated policy always has been that we don’t target any price levels or any bands, we allow the market to determine the prices,” Malhotra said at a press briefing Friday after the central bank cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time in six months. “Our effort has always been to reduce any abnormal or excessive volatility and that is what we will continue to endeavor.” The RBI may have limited room for further intervention after increasing dollar sales in its forward book. Such positions mean the RBI has pledged to sell dollars in the future and would need to source them for delivery when they mature. Its net short dollar book was around $64 billion as of October. Officials may also be holding fire in case they need to take stronger action. “I’m pretty sure the RBI has some lines drawn where they’ll really come in like gangbusters,” said Jamal Mecklai, managing director of Mecklai Financial Services Pvt and a four-decade veteran of India’s currency markets. “They are constrained by liquidity issues and reserve balance issues.” The RBI might get a break soon if India’s efforts to secure a deal with the US bear fruit. A team of negotiators from the Trump administration led by Deputy US Trade Representative Rick Switzer plans to travel to India this week to continue talks on a trade agreement. Malhotra has sought to talk up the outcome of recent trade discussions, saying last month that he expected a “good trade deal” that should ease pressure on the rupee. Yet for now pressure on the currency remains after it weakened past the psychologically key level of 90 — half the value it traded at in 2011. That’s complicating the task for Malhotra and the central bank officials as they seek to give the rupee more leeway while maintaining an orderly market — and avoiding the crises of the past. “The battle will continue,” said Mecklai, the veteran currency trader. “It’s in people’s minds that the rupee is going to keep depreciating forever.”",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/sell-100-million-every-minute-inside-india-s-rupee-defense-13714921.html

The maiden issue of the popular mattress-maker has been subscribed 7 percent on Day 1 so far. The IPO received bids for nearly 27 lakh shares, as against an offer size of 3.63 crore shares, according to data on NSE at 11.30 am. Retail investors have booked 35 percent of their reserved portion, while Non Institutional Investors (NII) have subscribed 3 percent of the portion kept for them. Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIB) are yet to make any substantial bid for the IPO. Ahead of listing, the unlisted shares of the company were trading with 18.46 percent grey market premium (GMP) over the IPO price, according to data on Investorgain and IPO Watch. The grey market estimates signal towards a decent listing for the company. However, it is important to note that grey market is an unofficial market, and the actual listing may be significantly different from estimates. Wakefit Innovations launched its IPO to raise Rs 1,289 crore through a fresh issue of shares worth Rs 377 crore and an offer for sale of up to 4.7 crore shares worth Rs 912 crore. The price band for the IPO has been set at Rs 185-195 per share. Investors can bid for a minimum of 76 shares, requiring an investment of Rs 14,820 at the upper price band, and in multiples thereafter. The IPO will remain open for public bidding between December 8 and December 10. The allotments are likely to be finalized by December 11, and the shares are scheduled to be listing on stock exchanges BSE and NSE on December 15. Wakefit Innovations is strategically positioned to capitalize on the strong growth of India’s home and furnishings industry through its vertically integrated, omnichannel business model and extensive product portfolio spanning mattresses, furniture, and home décor, said Master Capital Services. The domestic brokerage noted that India’s home and furnishings market, which was valued at around Rs 3 trillion in 2024, is projected to grow to up to Rs 5.9 trillion by calendar year 2030, marking an 11-13 percent CAGR. This will be driven by organized retail expansion, online adoption, and premiumization. Master Capital Services said that within this category, India’s mattress market is projected to grow at a 10–12 percent CAGR by calendar year 2030, driven by rising awareness of sleep wellness and demand for branded, ergonomic products. “Investors may consider the IPO as a potential long-term investment opportunity,” it said. Wakefit's​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ IPO is a major step of the brand going beyond its digital roots and establishing a solid omnichannel presence, said Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director, Vibhavangal Anukulakara Pvt. Ltd. “While the rollout of branded stores could potentially lead higher revenue clarity, it also entails greater operational risks,” the analyst cautioned. With earning power ramping up and anchor engagement being robust, the stock may become attractive to investors with a long-term thesis on consumption growth instead of a short-term listing pop ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌play, Maurya said.

50,Markets,IndiGo shares tumble 10%: Brokerages see costs rising for airline as FDTL norms trigger mass flight cancellations,"December 08, 2025 / 13:33 IST","The shares of InterGlobe Aviation, the parent company of IndiGo, crashed nearly 10 percent on December 8, extending losses for the seventh consecutive session. Brokerages have cautioned investors, with some reducing their target prices for the stock as the airline continues to face massive disruptions. The shares of the company were trading at Rs 4,842.50 apiece in the afternoon hours of Monday, the lowest level seen by the stock in seven months. IndiGo’s flight cancellations continued to persist on Monday, leading to widespread chaos at India's major airports. Delhi airport issued an advisory in the early hours of the day, stating that schedules remain unstable as the airline works to restore normal operations. Over six days, the airline cancelled more than 2,000 domestic and international flights. Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has sent a show-cause notice to IndiGo CEO Peter Elbers over large-scale disruptions and alleged non-compliances. The show-cause notice, issued to CEO Pieter Elbers, accused the airline of “significant lapses in planning, oversight and resource management” and a failure to adequately prepare for new Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) norms. A significant factor behind the chaos is a sharp shortage of crew, particularly pilots, following the introduction of revised Flight Duty Time Limitation (FDTL) norms last month. The new rules mandate more rest hours and humane rosters, but IndiGo has been struggling to realign its network accordingly. Union Civil Aviation Minister Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu today said that the IndiGo crisis was driven by problems in its crew rostering and internal planning system. Addressing the Rajya Sabha, Naidu said that strict Civil Aviation Requirements (CARs) are in place for passengers who have faced difficulties due to delays and cancellations. ""I want more players in the industry. Today, India has a capacity of five big airlines and there has been an effort from the ministry to encourage more airlines,"" he added. UBS kept its 'Buy' call on the shares of IndiGo, but reduced its target price for the stock to Rs 6,350 per share. This implies an upside potential of more than 18 percent from the stock's previous closing price. The international brokerage said that inadequate preparations for the revised FDTL norms have led to major disruptions. It raised cost estimates for FY26-FY28 to account for the additional crew required to comply with the FDTL norms and higher operational costs driven by rupee depreciation against the dollar. IndiGo's long-term growth outlook however remains robust, supported by its international expansion, UBS said. It added that the key downside risks include any contingent costs arising from operational disruptions and further depreciation. Jefferies kept a 'Buy' call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 7,025 per share. This implies an upside potential of nearly 31 percent from the stock's previous closing price. The international brokerage noted that the company has been hit the hardest by the new FDTL norms, which reduce pilot duty hours and increases crew requirements. It noted that the rule change coincided with IndiGo’s capacity expansion, technical issues and congestion, triggering cascading disruptions. Airline is now recalibrating schedules and expects normalcy by mid-December, Jefferies noted, adding that IndiGo will face rising costs from disruptions and higher crew expenses. JM Financial kept a 'Reduce' call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 5,570 apiece. This implies an upside potential of around 4 percent from the stock's previous closing price. The domestic brokerage said that recent mismanagement leading to significant flight cancellations is largely a function of new FDTL norms impact kicking in immediately post Airbus software upgrade challenges. ""The recent incident is likely to lead to a higher CAGR in CASK ex-fuel-ex-forex in future years subject to regulatory actions,"" it said. JM Financial noted that the show-cause notice sent to the CEO is likely to further dampen stock performance besides possible impending one-time penalty. “Near-term, we estimate earnings hit of 8-9% for FY26 if the situation lasts for a total of ~15 days. We await further clarity to revise our earnings estimates, given it’s a developing situation. Even as the FY26 earnings hit has been priced in, the stock is yet to price in 1) structural cost increase driven by regulatory actions 2) one time penalty 3) management change if any,” it added. IndiGo shares have fallen more than 13 percent in the past five days, and around 10 percent in the past one month. The shares of the airline have fallen more than 12 percent in the past six months, but are up nearly 9 percent in 2025 so far. The stock's P/E ratio currently stands at around 31.

Shah said the core growth driver for both the industry and his firm will remain customer experience, not pricing power. “If you can deliver a product with minimum margins to the middle class of the country, the market is infinite, that's how I look at it,” he told Moneycontrol in an exclusive interaction on the sidelines of the IPO launch, which opens on December 12. He argued that in India, asset management is fundamentally a volume business. “In this business one should not worry about margin, one should worry about volume,” he said. Lower fees, he added, strengthen the proposition rather than dilute it. “If I am charging less, my probability of meeting benchmark is higher. So, business is more sustainable,” he said. Shah acknowledged that ICICI Prudential AMC’s operating margins have stayed flat to slightly lower over the past two to three years, even as assets under management have risen sharply. But he said overall profitability has kept growing, helped by strong industry-wide sales momentum and steady investor flows. “Look at my profit growth over the last three years and see my margins have been dropping all three years, and still I am okay,” he said. He credited much of the industry’s expansion to regulation and investor experience. SEBI, he said, has ensured that mutual funds remain “very pure and transparent for the final investor,” while performance has done the rest. “In this business you can get money only if the past experience of the customer is good,” he said. That experience, he noted, has been shaped by the rise of SIPs and the way investors behaved in recent corrections. “When the markets corrected, the SIPs didn’t stop. When the markets corrected, more money came into the market,” he said, calling it evidence of how the Indian investor has evolved. A key element of ICICI Prudential’s strategy, Shah said, is recognising that “the customer is always pro-cyclical” while successful investing requires a counter-cyclical approach. He pointed to the AMC’s dynamic asset allocation and balanced advantage products, which he described as being designed to work against prevailing market emotion. “When the customer is selling, the fund is buying. When the markets are going up, the fund is actually selling,” he said, adding that the category has been built out over many years and now commands more than 25 percent market share in asset allocation products. On the margin debate, Shah underlined that the reported number is an aggregate of very different businesses. ICICI Prudential runs “five different businesses with five different margins” — liquid funds, overnight funds, equity funds, hybrid funds and others. “What margins you see is a mix of all these funds. And these all are different businesses,” he said. Liquid and overnight categories, largely institutional, naturally run at lower margins than equity and hybrid segments focused on individual investors. “What you see as a margin is a cocktail of all of this put together,” he said. Asked whether current margin levels can be maintained, Shah said no chief executive can forecast that with certainty because it depends on market conditions and growth across segments. “You make your assumptions how much will liquid grow, how much will equity grow. I am positioned. In each business I have got a good market share. I am focused on a profitable growth in every business of mine. What you see is an outcome,” he said. ICICI Prudential AMC’s IPO will be a 100 percent offer for sale, comprising up to 9.91 percent of the company’s equity share capital. The fund house — a joint venture between ICICI Bank and Prudential Corporation Holdings — will become the sixth AMC to list in India. The price band is set at ₹2,061–2,165 per share, valuing the company at around ₹10,600 crore at the top end. The issue opens on December 12 and closes on December 16. Financially, the AMC has delivered strong momentum ahead of its listing. It reported ₹1,618 crore in profit and ₹2,949 crore in revenue in the six months ended September 2025, marking year-on-year growth of 21.9 percent and 20 percent, respectively. For FY25, profit rose 29.3 percent to ₹2,651 crore, while revenue increased 32.4 percent to ₹4,977 crore. ICICI Prudential AMC currently commands a 13.2 percent market share and manages 143 mutual fund schemes, the largest suite among domestic asset managers.

56,Earnings,Goa nightclub blaze: CM Sawant drops major clue on what sparked it,"December 08, 2025 / 11:11 IST","The Goa nightclub tragedy that claimed 25 lives may have been sparked by “electric firecrackers” set off inside the packed venue, Chief Minister Pramod Sawant has said, citing a preliminary inquiry. The North Goa club, Birch by Romeo Lane in Arpora, was bustling with weekend crowds when a massive fire ripped through it around 11.45 pm on Saturday. The blaze exposed layers of illegalities, rule violations, and official complacency that allowed the establishment to operate without even a fire department NOC, according to officials quoted by PTI. Sawant said early findings point to the use of electric firecrackers inside the premises. Most victims died of suffocation after getting trapped on the ground floor and in the kitchen. Firefighters said narrow lanes blocked their vehicles, forcing water tankers to halt nearly 400 metres away. Small exits and a narrow bridge made escape even harder. The fire killed 20 staff members and five tourists, including four from Delhi. Many workers were from Uttarakhand, Jharkhand, Assam, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Nepal. Police have arrested four managers of the club, while an FIR has been registered against owners Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra and the event organisers. Three senior government officials have been suspended for clearing the nightclub’s operations in 2023 despite violations. Eyewitnesses told PTI the fire may have first erupted on the first floor where tourists were dancing. One survivor, Riya from Delhi, said firecrackers burst around dancers shortly before flames swept through the club, causing panic and a stampede-like situation. Another survivor, Fatima Shaikh from Hyderabad, said people ran downstairs into the kitchen, where many eventually got trapped. Temporary structures made of palm leaves caught fire within moments, turning the space into an inferno. The state government has announced Rs five lakh ex-gratia for the families of each victim and Rs 50,000 for the injured. Arrangements are being made to send the bodies to their home states. Sawant said an audit of all clubs operating without permission or with high footfall will now be undertaken. *With PTI inputs",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/goa-nightclub-blaze-cm-sawant-drops-major-clue-on-what-sparked-it-13714730.html

However, DITP business’ revenue growth was dragged by the company moving away from hardware-included deals to software deals. Affordability business’ scale-up is leading to higher working capital investments, which resulted in Rs(2.15)bn FCF for H1FY26. We are increasing our FY26E/27E EBITDA by 4.5%/5.2% on account of strong growth in the Issuing and Acquiring business. On FY28E, the stock trades at 27x EV/EBITDA and 52.9x P/E.

Growing demand from AI/data centers and rising C&I load represent an upside potential to India’s 100 GW wind target by 2030. The company plans to expand capacity through three new smartblade factories—two in Gujarat and Karnataka, and a third location to be finalized in 2 to 3 months—to shorten turnaround time, improve customer and site proximity, and enhance logistics and transportation efficiency.

66,Earnings,"IndiGo flight chaos to persist today, warns Delhi airport amid slow operational recovery","December 08, 2025 / 08:33 IST","Flight delays linked to IndiGo’s ongoing operational crisis are expected to continue on Monday, Delhi airport cautioned in an advisory issued early in the day. The airport authority urged travellers to verify their flight status before leaving for the terminal, noting that schedules remain unstable as the airline works to restore normal operations. Passenger Advisory issued at 06:30 Hours#DelhiAirport#PassengerAdvisory#DELAdvisorypic.twitter.com/hrpGxn7Oxr — Delhi Airport (@DelhiAirport) December 8, 2025 “IndiGo flights may continue to experience delays. Passengers are advised to check the latest flight status with their airline before heading to the airport to avoid any circumstances,” the advisory said. IndiGo’s nationwide operational crisis has continued to ripple across India, with thousands of passengers still facing cancellations, delays, missing baggage and pending refunds. Over six days, the airline cancelled more than 2,000 domestic and international flights, triggering widespread chaos at major airports. The airline said it has so far processed Rs 610 crore in refunds and delivered around 3,000 pieces of delayed baggage. On Sunday, IndiGo operated about 1,650 of its scheduled 2,300 flights, while roughly 650 remained cancelled. The carrier has announced automatic refunds for cancelled bookings and waived change and cancellation fees for travel between December 5 and 15. Meanwhile, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has granted a one-time 24-hour extension to IndiGo’s Accountable Manager and CEO to reply to the show-cause notice issued on December 6 over large-scale disruptions and alleged non-compliances. The officials sought additional time citing operational constraints linked to the scale of the airline’s network and multiple factors behind the disruptions. After reviewing the request, the DGCA extended the deadline only until 6 pm on December 8 and warned that no further extensions would be granted. Failure to submit a comprehensive response, the regulator said, would result in the case being decided ex parte. The show-cause notice, issued to CEO Pieter Elbers, accused the airline of “significant lapses in planning, oversight and resource management” and a failure to adequately prepare for new Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) norms. The DGCA said this amounted to prima facie non-compliance with the Aircraft Rules, 1937, and related crew duty and rest regulations. The regulator also flagged shortcomings in passenger care, noting that IndiGo did not provide mandatory assistance to those affected by cancellations and delays, in violation of passenger rights norms. As disruptions persisted on Sunday, over 400 flights were cancelled, IndiGo said it expects to stabilise operations by December 10. CEO Pieter Elbers said the airline is “recovering from the disruption” and plans to operate around 1,650 flights as it adapts to the impact of the revised FDTL rules. Major hubs, including Hyderabad, Kolkata and Delhi, saw the highest cancellations as thousands of passengers remained stranded or awaiting refunds.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/indigo-flight-chaos-to-persist-today-warns-delhi-airport-amid-slow-operational-recovery-13714589.html

78,Commodities,"Gold price today, December 4: Rates up at $4,213, moving closer to highest level since Diwali; Check 24K, 22K,18K prices in your city","December 04, 2025 / 14:10 IST","Spot gold price stood at $4,213 an ounce on December 4, as of 6:23 am IST, which is a recovery of 1.18 percent from yesterday's low at $4,169 support area. The yellow metal benefited from expectations of another rate cut in the upcoming US Federal Reserves policy meeting. India's December gold futures opened the trade today strong at Rs 1,30,356 per 10 grams of 24-carat purity, and many anticipated that the price would move closer to its highest level since Diwali. However, the morning trade soon saw the previous metal dip as low as 1,29,687, and now hovers at 1,29,700 levels. Meanwhile, rupee stood at 90.037 against the US dollar at 2:09 pm, up 0.75 percent from its price a week ago. Interest rate traders now comprise 89 percent vote for the probability of a 350-375 target rate bps in the upcoming US Federal Reserve meeting in December, as per FedWatch data that tracks the probabilities of changes to the Fed rate. The Indian Bullion and Jewellers Association (IBJA) announced the price of yellow at Rs 1,28,800 for 10 grams of 999 purity in their 18:30 pm rate session on December 3.  ""MCX Gold continues to attract strong buying interest as global safe-haven demand picks up, supported by expectations of FOMC rate cuts, a softer rupee, and renewed central-bank accumulation that reinforces its inflation-hedge appeal,"" said Rahul Gupta, Chief Business Officer, Ashika Group. The Augmont Bullion report, published on December 3, stated that gold has started its upward journey again; next target is $4,300 (Rs 1,32,000) and $4,345 (Rs 1,33,500) with strong support at $4,200 (Rs 1,29,000). ""Gold traded positive in MCX as the rupee slipped amid uncertainty over the India-US trade deal, and record-high bullion and metal prices. Comex Gold held near $4,200 in a tight intraday range between $4,228 and $4,200,"" said Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities. ""ADP Nonfarm Payrolls and the Core PCE Price Index remain key triggers this week. Rupee weakness continues to give MCX Gold an additional lift, but the current zone is overbought and a retracement toward the Rs 1,27,000 support cannot be ruled out,"" said Trivedi. Gupta believes that as long as prices hold above Rs 1,28,200, a critical short-term support , the upside trajectory toward Rs 1,33,000 remains intact; however, a decisive break below Rs1,27,000 could trigger a deeper move toward Rs 1,24,500.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/gold-price-today-december-4-rates-up-at-4-213-moving-closer-to-highest-level-since-diwali-check-24k-22k-18k-prices-in-your-city-13709259.html
79,Commodities,Bitcoin price swings amid increased volatility as uncertainty looms over Fed rate cut,"December 02, 2025 / 14:19 IST","Bitcoin’s price stood just above $87,027 on December 2, as of 1:22  a.m (IST), after investors sentiment remained cautious ahead of the Fed rate cut next week. The morning session saw the cryptocurrency fall as low as $84,682 and peaked just above $87,193. Traders are pricing in an 88% chance of a December Fed rate cut, per CME's FedWatch tool. As per Reuters, as many as five of the 12 voting policymakers on the central bank's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee have opposed cutting rates further, while a core of three members of the Washington-based Board of Governors wants rates to fall. ""BTC traded within the $84K–$88K range, with buyers stepping in on dips. After briefly testing the $84K–$85K support zone, the market shifted into consolidation. A late-session push lifted BTC back above $86K.  If the price holds above $85.5K, momentum could build toward $87.5K–$88K, the next resistance zone. A clean break above this level may open a move toward $89K–$90K. Investors can follow macro drivers closely, especially shifting Fed expectations,"" said CoinSwitch Markets Desk. The largest cryptocurrency dipped as low as $83,909 and peaked at $86,832 during yesterday’s trade.  Bitcoin reached $126,000 in October during the market's peak performance period. It hit the lowest in April 2025, when its price hovered around $75,000 level. “Over the past 24 hours, a key development was that the Bank of Japan hinted at a potential rate hike, triggering a sharp rise in Japanese bond yields, amidst its move to strengthen the Yen. Experts note that this shift is pulling liquidity out of global markets, tightening financial conditions at a moment when risk assets were already unpopular. With experts projecting capital retreats moving towards safer, income-generating positions, this could further dip the sentiment scale towards Fear,” said Nischal Shetty, Founder, WazirX. The volatility has been observed across prices of other tokens, too, with ETH down 1.25 percent, BNB down 0.08 percent, SOL 0.03 percent, while ADA is up 0.75 percent in the last 24 hours. Check out below to see prices of top cryptocurrencies on December 2, as of 1:22 p.m.  “Ethereum is stabilising near $2,800 after briefly dipping to $2,700. Altcoins remain under pressure, with most major tokens recording 5–10 percent weekly losses amid thin liquidity and reduced speculative activity. Looking ahead, the broader trend will likely depend on macro cues, particularly U.S. inflation data and Fed rate expectations,” said Riya Sehgal, Research Analyst, Delta Exchange.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/bitcoin-price-swings-amid-increased-volatility-as-uncertainty-looms-over-fed-rate-cut-13706568.html
80,Commodities,"Copper climbs to record as China policy, US imports spur rally","December 08, 2025 / 13:17 IST","Copper rose to an all-time high after China set domestic growth as its top economic priority for next year, and amid stockpiling of the metal in the US. The industrial metal climbed as much as 1.3% to $11,771 a ton, blazing past a record set in the previous session. The latest spike came after Beijing said on Monday it would stick with a “more proactive” fiscal approach and maintain a “moderately loose” monetary stance for the world’s second-largest economy. “The Politburo readouts present a more proactive macro environment than investors have expected,” said Xu Wanqiu, an analyst with Chinese brokerage Cofco Futures Co.. “Copper will benefit from policy support toward power-grid upgrades, computing power. The momentum remains very bullish,” she said. Trade data from China was also supportive, with exports rebounding last month to beat estimates and push the country’s trade surplus past $1 trillion for the first time in any year. Copper – a metal critical for electrification and the energy transition – has gained more than 30% on the London Metal Exchange this year. New demand fueled by data centers and electric vehicles has come up against tight global supply, with smelting capacity growing faster than mines can keep up. A series of mine outages has exacerbated a shortage of raw materials. The rally has accelerated in recent weeks on concerns over an exodus of the metal to the US in anticipation that President Donald Trump will impose tariffs next year. This has squeezed inventories and sent premiums elsewhere to unprecedented highs, while also causing futures in New York to spike above those on the LME. Global supply of refined copper could see a shortfall of 450,000 tons in 2026, partly due to this stockpiling in America, analysts from Chinese brokerage Citic Securities Co. said in a note. Prices must average above $12,000 a ton next year to attract the investment needed in new mining capacity to ensure sufficient supply in the medium- to long-term, the Citic analysts, led by Ao Chong, said. Copper was up 0.8% at $11,713 a ton on the LME as of 7:18 a.m in London. Other metals were mostly higher, with zinc up 0.8% and aluminum 0.5%.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/copper-climbs-to-record-as-china-policy-us-imports-spur-rally-13715182.html
81,Commodities,Oil prices fall on weak demand as markets await Ukraine peace effort for supply signs,"December 03, 2025 / 08:14 IST","Oil prices fell for a second day on Wednesday as investors waited to see if peace talks in the Russia-Ukraine war could open up more supply amid wider concerns about a surplus, highlighted by rising inventories. Brent crude futures were down 13 cents, or 0.21%, at $62.32 a barrel at 0221 GMT, after falling 1.1% in the previous session. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude lost 12 cents, or 0.20%, to trade at $58.52 a barrel, after dropping 1.2% on Tuesday. Russia and the U.S. did not reach a compromise on a possible peace deal for Ukraine after a five-hour meeting between President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump's top envoys, the Russian government said on Wednesday. Oil markets are awaiting the outcome of the talks to see if a deal could lead to the removal of sanctions on Russian companies, including major oil companies Rosneft and Lukoil, that would free up restricted oil supply. Accusations from Putin on Tuesday that European powers are hindering U.S. attempts to end the war by putting forward proposals they knew would be ""absolutely unacceptable"" to Moscow have increased concerns Russian supply will continue to be restricted to buyers such as China and India as the talks may not lead to a deal. Tony Sycamore, market analyst with IG, said in a note that despite these worries about the talks being inconclusive ""concerns over an oversupply glut and soft demand continue to weigh on the crude oil price, which must remain above support in the mid $50's to avoid a deeper setback."" The war in Ukraine following Russia's invasion in 2022 has widened and Ukraine is now regularly striking Russian oil infrastructure with drones. Recent attacks on export sites on the Russian Black Sea coast have highlighted the geopolitical concerns stemming from the war. Sources said on Tuesday that the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which ships oil from Russia and Kazakhstan, aims to complete repairs on its third single point mooring in the Black Sea ahead of schedule, seeking to restore full oil export capacity after a drone attack hit one of its other moorings. Rising U.S. inventories also added to the concerns about a crude surplus. The American Petroleum Institute reported on Tuesday U.S. crude and fuel inventories rose last week, market sources said, citing the API figures. Crude stocks rose by 2.48 million barrels in the week ended November 28, gasoline inventories increased by 3.14 million barrels, while distillate inventories rose by 2.88 million barrels, the API said, according to the sources. The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release official government stockpile data later on Wednesday.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/commodities/oil-prices-fall-on-weak-demand-as-markets-await-ukraine-peace-effort-for-supply-signs-13707670.html
82,Commodities,Goa nightclub blaze: CM Sawant drops major clue on what sparked it,"December 08, 2025 / 11:11 IST","The Goa nightclub tragedy that claimed 25 lives may have been sparked by “electric firecrackers” set off inside the packed venue, Chief Minister Pramod Sawant has said, citing a preliminary inquiry. The North Goa club, Birch by Romeo Lane in Arpora, was bustling with weekend crowds when a massive fire ripped through it around 11.45 pm on Saturday. The blaze exposed layers of illegalities, rule violations, and official complacency that allowed the establishment to operate without even a fire department NOC, according to officials quoted by PTI. Sawant said early findings point to the use of electric firecrackers inside the premises. Most victims died of suffocation after getting trapped on the ground floor and in the kitchen. Firefighters said narrow lanes blocked their vehicles, forcing water tankers to halt nearly 400 metres away. Small exits and a narrow bridge made escape even harder. The fire killed 20 staff members and five tourists, including four from Delhi. Many workers were from Uttarakhand, Jharkhand, Assam, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Nepal. Police have arrested four managers of the club, while an FIR has been registered against owners Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra and the event organisers. Three senior government officials have been suspended for clearing the nightclub’s operations in 2023 despite violations. Eyewitnesses told PTI the fire may have first erupted on the first floor where tourists were dancing. One survivor, Riya from Delhi, said firecrackers burst around dancers shortly before flames swept through the club, causing panic and a stampede-like situation. Another survivor, Fatima Shaikh from Hyderabad, said people ran downstairs into the kitchen, where many eventually got trapped. Temporary structures made of palm leaves caught fire within moments, turning the space into an inferno. The state government has announced Rs five lakh ex-gratia for the families of each victim and Rs 50,000 for the injured. Arrangements are being made to send the bodies to their home states. Sawant said an audit of all clubs operating without permission or with high footfall will now be undertaken. *With PTI inputs",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/goa-nightclub-blaze-cm-sawant-drops-major-clue-on-what-sparked-it-13714730.html

India’s December silver futures opened the Friday session at Rs 1,79,308 per 1 kilogram of 999 purity, and continued to hover at Rs 1,82,109 as of 1:07 p.m (IST), which is approximately 2.23 percent up from previous close. The Indian Bullion and Jewellers Association (IBJA) announced the price of yellow at Rs 1,76,625 for 1 kilogram of 999 purity in their 18:30 p.m rate session on December 4. Check out below to see the prices of 1 kilogram of 999 purity silver.  Silver rates across India’s major cities showed remarkable uniformity, with only marginal differences due to local taxes, jeweller margins, and logistics costs.  The Augmont Bullion report published on December stated that Silver can continue its rally towards $60 (Rs 1,85,500) and $62 (Rs 1,91,000), with firm support at $57 (Rs 1,77,000), if tight supply conditions continue. ""Industrial demand signals have turned softer, keeping near-term trading momentum on the lighter side. Broader direction remains dependent on global manufacturing trends and macro flows.

84,Commodities,"Gold vs silver: With rupee at 90 and Fed decision due, which metal has more steam left?","December 07, 2025 / 17:18 IST","Gold prices are likely to remain firm in the coming week, driven by investor focus on the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy outcome, combined with weakness in the rupee, according to analysts. The precious metal's bias remains positive amid expectations of an interest rate cut and sustained central bank purchases, they added. ""Gold is expected to remain on positive side as traders will be focusing on the US Federal Reserve's FOMC meeting outcome and the Fed Chair Jerome Powell's commentary as well, while on the data front, the focus will be on China's trade and inflation data and the US jobs data,"" Pranav Mer, Vice President, EBG - Commodity & Currency Research, JM Financial Services Ltd, said. On the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), gold futures appreciated by Rs 958, or 0.74 per cent, this week, outperforming the global prices. ""Gold prices in the Indian markets have rallied more than the Comex gold prices on account of rupee depreciation against the dollar. The rupee is now at the highest mark of 90, which makes gold in Indian currency costlier,"" Prathamesh Mallya, DVP - Research, Non-Agri Commodities and Currencies, Angel One, said. Mallya added that the rally in gold prices might continue in the week ahead as a boost from the rate cut, increasing central bank demand for gold, and fund buying. In the international markets, Comex gold futures slipped by USD 11.9, or 0.28 per cent, during the week. Mer noted that gold prices consolidated within a range during the week but stayed supported by a weaker dollar and rising bets for an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve (Fed) at its December 10 meeting. Meanwhile, silver continues to outshine gold, scaling fresh record highs on industrial demand. On the MCX, silver futures skyrocketed by Rs 8,427, or 4.81 per cent, during the week. On Friday, the white metal surged by Rs 7,096, or 3.98 per cent, to hit a record of Rs 1,85,234 per kilogram. ""In the first half of the week, silver futures spiked close to Rs 1.80 lakh per kg and briefly touched fresh highs. Since then, prices have cooled off slightly but are still sitting on massive month-on-month gains,"" Chirag Doshi, CIO- Fixed Income, LGT Wealth India, said. He added that markets are consolidating at higher levels after a strong run, with traders increasingly using sharp intraday spikes in silver as opportunities to book profits. In the overseas markets, Comex silver futures rose by USD 1.89, or 3.30 per cent, during the week. On Friday, the metal soared by USD 2.4, or 4.19 per cent, to hit a lifetime high of USD 59.90 per ounce. ""Silver prices rose to yet another all-time high and moved close to USD 60 per ounce in the international market, while on the domestic market, prices rose close to Rs 1,90,000 per kg,"" Mer said, attributing the rally to strong industrial demand and tight supplies. He added that the momentum could push silver prices towards Rs 2,00,000-2,25,000 levels in the short term. Analysts said the coming week will be crucial for bullion prices as monetary policy cues from the Fed, macroeconomic data from China and the US, and rupee trends will guide direction.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/commodities/gold-vs-silver-with-rupee-at-90-and-fed-decision-due-which-metal-has-more-steam-left-13714209.html
85,Commodities,Bullion eyes further gains amid Russia-Ukraine tensions and dovish sentiment,"November 30, 2025 / 21:01 IST","Rising expectations of a December rate cut reignited risk appetite this week (ended November 28), reversing the earlier selloff triggered by anxiety over stretched AI valuations. The dollar spent most of the week below the 100 mark as a run of softer US economic data strengthened confidence that the Federal Reserve will move ahead with a 25 bps rate cut on December 10. Cooling retail sales, a modest uptick in producer inflation, accelerating private-sector job losses, and US consumer confidence falling to a seven-month low all reinforced the dovish tone already echoed by several Fed officials. According to CME data, markets are now pricing in nearly an 87 percent probability of a December cut. US equities rallied, with the three major indexes finishing the week up 3 percent to 5 percent, signaling a solid rebound in sentiment. Precious metals rallied on the dovish shift, with silver stealing the spotlight after a remarkable 12 percent jump on the week, far outpacing gold’s solid 4 percent gain. Gold logged its fourth straight monthly rise, while silver notched its seventh consecutive monthly advance and its biggest monthly gain of 2025 at 18.7 percent. Chinese inventories at decade lows, supply tightness concerns, strong ETF inflows, and growing conviction in a December rate cut all helped drive COMEX silver to a record $57.2 per ounce. On the daily chart, MCX Silver futures posted a strong rally on Friday, gaining 5.64 percent and decisively breaking above the previous two swing highs at Rs 1,65,818 per kg and Rs 1,70,415 per kg. Prices settled at a fresh all-time high of Rs 1,71,637. The bullish momentum is expected to persist in the coming week, though the price may encounter initial resistance near Rs 1,76,900, followed by Rs 1,84,100. On the downside, immediate support is seen around Rs 1,65,800, with the next support at Rs 1,62,000. Base metals on the LME ended the week on strong footing, with copper leading the pack after rising more than 3 percent to trade near $11,180 a ton. Aluminium and zinc followed with gains of over 2 percent. Copper’s late-week rally brought prices back toward last month’s highs, supported by tightening global supply and improving macro sentiment. A string of mine disruptions, including halted output at Freeport-McMoRan’s Grasberg mine and slower-than-expected production recovery in Chile and Peru, prompted producers to sharply raise premiums, with Codelco even offering record contract prices to buyers in Asia and Europe. Gold & Silver Rates Today Monday, 08th December, 2025 Gold Rate in Mumbai Today Monday, 08th December, 2025 Silver Rate in Mumbai Today Crude oil, by contrast, remained under pressure. WTI fell to a five-week low of $57.1 per barrel as optimism grew around a potential peace framework between Russia and Ukraine, which could eventually ease restrictions on Russian energy exports and add supply to global markets. Signals from both President Zelenskiy and President Putin that they are open to advancing US-backed draft proposals strengthened hopes of progress. Oil later recovered slightly to close near $58.5 per barrel, but still ended the week down about 4 percent, with traders now focused on the upcoming OPEC+ meeting, where the group is expected to maintain its pause on production increases into early 2026. Oil prices are likely to remain volatile amid growing doubts over whether any agreement can be reached, following Russia’s launch of approximately 36 missiles and nearly 600 drones targeting locations across Ukraine over the weekend. This attack may also affect the US delegation’s upcoming visit to Moscow, including Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, to discuss the draft peace plan. Looking ahead, markets are preparing for a busy calendar of data releases and speech by Fed Chair Powell. Final PMI readings from major economies, US ADP employment data for November, September’s PCE inflation report, and the University of Michigan’s sentiment and inflation expectations surveys are all due this week. With the return of dovish rhetoric alongside reports that Kevin Hassett, known for favouring lower rates, is a leading candidate to replace Chair Powell, any additional softness in upcoming US data may solidify expectations of a rate cut. On the other hand, stronger-than-expected numbers could challenge prevailing expectations and prompt a recalibration of rate-cut bets.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/commodities/bullion-eyes-further-gains-amid-russia-ukraine-tensions-and-dovish-sentiment-13703321.html

Check out below to see prices of gold based on their purity.  Gold rates across India’s major cities showed remarkable uniformity, with only marginal differences due to local taxes, jeweller margins, and logistics costs.  The Augmont Bullion report published on December 3, stated that gold has started its upward journey again; next target is $4,300 (Rs 1,32,000) and $4,345 (Rs 1,33,500) with strong support at $4,200 (Rs 1,29,000). ""With the recent outbreak of uncertainty around the world, combined with consistent demand for gold within the domestic market, gold retains its attractiveness as a secure investment. Even though the price has decreased slightly from the previous trading session, the overall return on gold remains at a high point due to ongoing interest from both investors and households ahead of holiday shopping,"" said Aksha Kamboj, Vice President, India Bullion & Jewellers Association (IBJA). According to gold analysts gold prices are likely to recover as the U.S Federal Reserves and the Reserve Bank of India are set to announce policy rates, which could give a push to gold’s momentum in the coming days. “If the central bank delivers the expected quarter-point cut and signals comfort with easing into early 2026, gold should hold support near the 4,200 level,” according to Investing(dot)com. As per Augmont report, gold and silver continue to rise as recent data indicates a gradual cooling of the US economy, combined with dovish signals from Fed policymakers, has bolstered market expectations for a 25-basis-point rate cut at the US central bank's meeting next week, with traders pricing in an 89 percent chance of the move ""Given fluctuations in foreign currency values, as well as ongoing volatility in the global market, it is expected that gold will remain a viable hedge against inflation. Today’s small decline can be viewed as just a minor correction during the ongoing overall upward trend that has been occurring from past few days,"" said Kamboj.

The maiden issue of the pharma company has been subscribed 27 percent so far on Day 1. The IPO received bids for 12.24 lakh shares, as against the offer size of 45.72 lakh shares, according to data on NSE at 12 pm. Retail investors have booked 41 percent of their reserved portion, while Non-Institutional Investors (NII) have subscribed 28 percent of their allotted quota. Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIB) are yet to make any substantial bid for the IPO. Ahead of listing, the unlisted shares of Corona Remedies were trading with more than 27 percent grey market premium over the IPO price, according to data on Investorgain and IPO Watch. This has fallen from the 34 percent GMP quoted by the sites on Friday. However, the grey market estimates still signal a strong listing for the company. Corona Remedies launched its IPO today to raise more than Rs 655 crore through an entirely offer for sale (OFS) of shares with no fresh issue component. This means that all of the IPO proceeds will go the selling investors and not the company. The price band for the IPO has been set at Rs 1,008-1,062 per share. Investors can bid for a minimum of 14 shares, requiring an investment of Rs 14,868 per lot, and in multiples thereafter.

91,Commodities,"Global commodity prices expected to decline by roughly 7%, precious metals to rise 5% in 2026: Report","November 30, 2025 / 12:09 IST","Global commodity prices are expected to fall by nearly 7 per cent in 2026, continuing a fourth straight year of decline. The fall is being linked to slower global economic growth, trade tensions, policy uncertainty, and abundant oil supplies. Precious metals, however, are projected to rise by around 5 per cent next year, building on a strong investment-led gain of over 40 per cent in 2025, according to a report by financial services firm Prabhudas Lilladher. In the metals segment, global copper prices touched nearly USD 11,200 per tonne due to tight supply and mining disruptions. As per the report, Gold reached a record high of USD 4,370 an ounce in late October 2025, while Indian gold prices hovered around Rs 1,27,500 per 10 grams amid festive and safe-haven demand. The report also said base metals like copper, aluminium, and zinc are expected to remain supported by limited supply and steady demand, though sharp gains are unlikely without major disruptions. Precious metals such as gold and silver are expected to retain their safe-haven status, with prices responding to movements in the U.S. dollar, inflation trends, and geopolitical factors. Energy prices are likely to dip about 10 per cent in 2026, following a 12 per cent drop in 2025. Metals and minerals are expected to remain steady, while agricultural commodities may edge lower due to ample supply. In October, global crude markets faced challenges, but India's fuel consumption climbed to a five-month high. Demand rose 7.7 per cent from September to 20.17 million metric tonnes, boosted by post-monsoon transport needs. Gasoline demand increased by 8 per cent and diesel by 12.2 per cent month-on-month. The domestic price of oil-linked natural gas for November was set at USD 6.55 per MMBtu, down from USD 6.96 in October. The report noted that while oversupply from OPEC+ and rising exports from non-OPEC nations continue to pressure prices, geopolitical shocks or a rebound in industrial fuel demand could cause short-term spikes. Agricultural commodities also reflected seasonal patterns. The Agricultural Commodity Price Index (ACPI) declined in October due to good harvests and abundant global supplies of grains, oilseeds, and beverages. In India, steady arrivals of wheat, rice, and oilseeds kept domestic prices stable. Prabhudas Lilladher said that while extreme weather, higher input costs, or stronger global trade could lift prices, slower growth and large inventories may push them lower. Looking ahead, the firm projects Brent crude (crude oil from the North Sea that serves as a global price benchmark for about two-thirds of the world's crude oil) to average between USD 60 and 70 per barrel in 2026, with downside risk to USD 56 if surplus supplies persist and upside potential beyond USD 85 if disruptions occur. Gold may rise to USD 4,500 per ounce, while silver is expected to trade between USD 50 and 60 per ounce through 2025. The World Bank anticipates a mild 2 per cent decline in the agricultural price index in 2026, keeping the overall commodity outlook subdued.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/commodities/global-commodity-prices-expected-to-decline-by-roughly-7-precious-metals-to-rise-5-in-2026-report-13703069.html
92,Commodities,"Oil falls on drawn-out Ukraine peace talks, all eyes on upcoming OPEC+ meeting","November 29, 2025 / 03:03 IST","Crude futures fell marginally on Friday as investors considered oil's geopolitical risk premium amid drawn-out Russia-Ukraine peace talks, while keeping an eye on Sunday's OPEC+ meeting for clues about potential output changes. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures resumed trading after being frozen due to a system outage at exchange operator CME Group, blamed on a cooling issue at CyrusOne data centres. Brent trades on the Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE. Front-month Brent crude futures for January, which expire on Friday, settled down 14 cents, or 0.22%, at $63.20 a barrel. The more active February contract settled at $62.38, down 49 cents on Thursday's close. WTI crude settled at $58.55 a barrel, down 10 cents, or 0.17%, from Wednesday's close. There was no settlement on Thursday due to the Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S. Despite being up around 1% for the week, both contracts settled down for the fourth straight month, their longest losing streak since 2023, as expectations for higher global supply weighed on prices. The strength of fuel refining profit margins has supported crude demand in some places, but the bearish impact of an expected oil surplus is pressuring prices, said Rystad analyst Janiv Shah. U.S. oil production rose to record highs in September, data from the Energy Information Administration showed on Friday, deepening concerns that the market is heading towards a surplus. U.S. crude oil output rose 44,000 barrels per day in September to a record 13.84 million bpd, according to the EIA data. [EIA/PSM] A Reuters survey of 35 economists and analysts showed respondents expect Brent to average $62.23 per barrel in 2026, down from October's forecast of $63.15. The benchmark has averaged $68.80 per barrel so far in 2025, LSEG data showed. [O/POLL] Signs that a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia might be close pushed oil prices down sharply earlier this week, but they have recovered over the past three sessions as negotiations dragged on. ""Futures had been anticipating some sort of a peace agreement which has kept pressure on prices,"" Dennis Kissler, senior vice president of trading at BOK Financial, said in a note on Friday. ""Still, little is known at this time, and no agreement will likely mean even tighter sanctions on Russia's oil exports."" On Sunday, OPEC+ is likely to leave oil output levels unchanged at its meetings and to agree on a mechanism to assess members' maximum production capacity, two delegates from the group and a source familiar with the group's talks told Reuters. Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, is expected to lower its January crude price for Asian buyers for a second month to its lowest in five years, under pressure from ample supplies and the surplus outlook, sources told Reuters on Friday.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/commodities/oil-falls-on-drawn-out-ukraine-peace-talks-all-eyes-on-upcoming-opec-meeting-13702326.html

The airport authority urged travellers to verify their flight status before leaving for the terminal, noting that schedules remain unstable as the airline works to restore normal operations. Passenger Advisory issued at 06:30 Hours#DelhiAirport#PassengerAdvisory#DELAdvisorypic.twitter.com/hrpGxn7Oxr — Delhi Airport (@DelhiAirport) December 8, 2025 “IndiGo flights may continue to experience delays. Passengers are advised to check the latest flight status with their airline before heading to the airport to avoid any circumstances,” the advisory said. IndiGo’s nationwide operational crisis has continued to ripple across India, with thousands of passengers still facing cancellations, delays, missing baggage and pending refunds. Over six days, the airline cancelled more than 2,000 domestic and international flights, triggering widespread chaos at major airports. The airline said it has so far processed Rs 610 crore in refunds and delivered around 3,000 pieces of delayed baggage. On Sunday, IndiGo operated about 1,650 of its scheduled 2,300 flights, while roughly 650 remained cancelled. The carrier has announced automatic refunds for cancelled bookings and waived change and cancellation fees for travel between December 5 and 15. Meanwhile, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has granted a one-time 24-hour extension to IndiGo’s Accountable Manager and CEO to reply to the show-cause notice issued on December 6 over large-scale disruptions and alleged non-compliances. The officials sought additional time citing operational constraints linked to the scale of the airline’s network and multiple factors behind the disruptions. After reviewing the request, the DGCA extended the deadline only until 6 pm on December 8 and warned that no further extensions would be granted. Failure to submit a comprehensive response, the regulator said, would result in the case being decided ex parte. The show-cause notice, issued to CEO Pieter Elbers, accused the airline of “significant lapses in planning, oversight and resource management” and a failure to adequately prepare for new Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) norms. The DGCA said this amounted to prima facie non-compliance with the Aircraft Rules, 1937, and related crew duty and rest regulations. The regulator also flagged shortcomings in passenger care, noting that IndiGo did not provide mandatory assistance to those affected by cancellations and delays, in violation of passenger rights norms. As disruptions persisted on Sunday, over 400 flights were cancelled, IndiGo said it expects to stabilise operations by December 10. CEO Pieter Elbers said the airline is “recovering from the disruption” and plans to operate around 1,650 flights as it adapts to the impact of the revised FDTL rules. Major hubs, including Hyderabad, Kolkata and Delhi, saw the highest cancellations as thousands of passengers remained stranded or awaiting refunds.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/indigo-flight-chaos-to-persist-today-warns-delhi-airport-amid-slow-operational-recovery-13714589.html

This will be driven by organized retail expansion, online adoption, and premiumization.

96,Commodities,India's October-November sugar output rises 43% on higher recovery rates,"December 02, 2025 / 14:07 IST","India's sugar production in the first two months of the 2025/26 season, which began on October 1, rose 43% from a year earlier, driven by better recovery rates and faster crushing across major producing states, leading industry bodies said on Tuesday. The higher output is expected to allow the world's second-largest sugar producer to export surplus supplies without risk of domestic shortages, although it could weigh on global prices. Mills have produced 4.1 million metric tons of sugar by the end of November, up from last year's 2.88 million tons, the Indian Sugar & Bio-Energy Manufacturers Association (ISMA) said in a statement. Production in the western state of Maharashtra, India's biggest sugar-producing state, more than tripled from last year to 1.7 million tons, while it rose by 9% in northern state of Uttar Pradesh to 1.4 million tons, the ISMA said. However, production in the southern state of Karnataka slipped to 774,000 tons from 812,000 tons a year earlier, as farmer protests demanding higher cane prices disrupted crushing operations. The sugar recovery rate in the first two months of the season rose to 8.51% compared to 8.29% a year ago, the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories (NFCSF) said. The sugar recovery rate, a key industry metric, measures the percentage of sugar extracted from the sugarcane stalks. The government should allow an additional 1 million metric tons of sugar exports in the current season as lower sugar diversion for ethanol production is creating a larger exportable surplus, the NFCSF said. India last month allowed exports of 1.5 million metric tons of sugar in the current season, although mills are struggling to secure export deals as global prices remain below domestic rates.

Gold was flat. Investors are wagering that a new Federal Reserve chair and the release of delayed US economic data this month will support President Donald Trump’s calls for monetary easing. The recent gains in precious metals reflect the potential for cuts to gather pace after Jerome Powell’s term ends in May.

The precious metal of 99.9 per cent purity had settled at Rs 1,33,200 per 10 grams in the previous market session. ""Gold edged lower on Tuesday as traders booked profits after prices hit a multi-week high in the previous session, while a cautious approach adopted by traders before the important US macro data due later this week also contributed to the decline,"" Saumil Gandhi, Senior Analyst - Commodities at HDFC Securities, said.

She noted that the latest US economic data added to the cautious tone, with the Institute for Supply Management reporting that manufacturing contracted for a ninth consecutive month, adding pressure on the Fed to ease policy.

It seems plausible based on seasonal patterns.

The precious metal rose as much as 1.4% to $57.29 in the spot market, surpassing a peak struck on Friday, when trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange was disrupted for several hours by a data-center fault. With Comex futures and options contracts affected, some traders said they had reverted to calling brokers and dealers by phone to hedge their exposures. Silver has almost doubled in value this year and has gained for a sixth consecutive day. Its most recent surge has been supported by renewed concerns of tightness in the global market. Despite a record amount of metal flowing into London to ease a historic squeeze, the cost of borrowing the metal over one month remains elevated. Other hubs are under pressure, with silver inventories in warehouses linked to the Shanghai Futures Exchange recently hitting their lowest in nearly a decade, bourse data shows. Markets are also fully pricing in a quarter-point rate cut in the US this month on continued weakness in the American labor market and a series of dovish comments by Federal Reserve officials. The release of economic data delayed by the government’s six-week shutdown has also supported the case for lower borrowing costs, which typically benefit non-yielding precious metals.

104,Commodities,"Hindustan Zinc shares rise 3% as silver prices surge, stock extends gains for fourth session","November 28, 2025 / 13:02 IST","The shares of Hindustan Zinc jumped more than 3 percent on November 28 as sharp rise in silver prices boosted investor sentiment for the stock. The shares of the company were trading at Rs 489.20 apiece. The stock has now extended gains for the fourth consecutive session, rising around 8 percent during the period of time. It is currently among the top gainers on the Nifty Metal index. Silver futures on the Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX) with December expiry rose nearly 2 percent to Rs 1.65 lakh per kilogram. Silver futures on the exchange with March and May expiries rose more than 1.5 percent each. Domestic prices of silver also increased, with one kilogram of silver becoming expensive by Rs 3,000 in a day to be priced at Rs 1.76 lakh, according to data on Investorgain. Notably, this sharp rise comes after days of decline. Silver prices are rising on the back of strong industrial demand, supply tightness and expectations of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve. ""The price of gold and silver is not primarily driven by corporate profits or economic-growth expectations. Instead, it depends on factors like interest rates, inflation expectation, currency strength/weakness, and supply-demand balance,"" said Nirpendra Yadav, Senior Commodity Research Analyst at Bonanza. Inflation concerns, fears of currency debasement, and general macro uncertainty have boosted demand for precious metals even as equities look strong, the analyst said. ""For silver specifically, strong industrial demand, supply tightness, and safe-haven demand have helped sustain price strength. Even if stocks and gold both go up together, gold and silver still provide diversification due to their low or unstable correlation with stocks, they can improve a portfolio’s risk- adjusted returns,"" he added. ""During periods of falling real interest rates or weak economic growth, gold and equities can even move in the same direction. Precious metal still has some space left in it and Nifty has just started the rally, Nifty sustaining above 26300 will triggered interest to buyers, overall moneyness from precious metal is yet not expected to reduce as gold prices have rebounded once again due to the global uncertainty and an increase in the buying of central banks. The traditional negative correlation between equities and bullion may get stronger if key drivers of prices like peace talk between Russia-Ukraine and cease fire in the middle east, amid some progress in the trade deal amongst major economies, improves,"" Yadav added. The stock was also lifted by the Rare Earth Magnet scheme recently approved by the Cabinet. Hindustan Zinc is the largest producer of silver in India, and produces refined silver with a minimum 99.9 percent purity. The sharp rise in the bullion's prices is expected to further boost the stock. Hindustan Zinc shares jumped more than 6 percent in the past five days, and around 8 percent in the past six months. The stock is gained around 10 percent in 2025 so far. The shares of the Vedanta Group-company fell around 1.5 percent in the past one year, but have risen around 112 percent in the past five years. After hitting a 52-week low of Rs 378.15 apiece in March this year, the stock sharply surged around 45 percent in three months to hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 546.80 apiece in June, on the back of soaring silver prices.

The Indian Bullion and Jewellers Association (IBJA) announced the price of yellow at Rs 1,27,845 for 10 grams of 999 purity in their 18:30 p.m rate session on December 4.  Gold rates across India’s major cities showed remarkable uniformity, with only marginal differences due to local taxes, jeweller margins, and logistics costs.  ""Traders are tempering expectations of early rate cuts, and therefore, sentiments remain subdued. The current level may see some selective buying, but overall momentum stays restricted. Unless major economic data sparks a shift, gold is likely to move in a narrow range, driven mostly by short-term market cues,"" said Aksha Kamboj, Vice President, India Bullion & Jewellers Association. Augumont Bullion report published on December 5, stated that gold has started its upward journey again; the next target is $4,300 (Rs 1,32,000) and $4,345 (Rs 1,33,500) with strong support at $4,200 (Rs 1,29,000). ""For gold into 2026, I look upon the recent correction as a healthy consolidation after a very robust rally in 2025. The fundamental drivers are still there: central-bank purchases, geopolitical uncertainty, a softer U.S. dollar, and cautious global growth. The overarching trend, provided gold holds its 2025 support levels, is higher, albeit at a more moderate pace. Considering ongoing inflationary pressures and changing monetary policies, I feel that steady accumulation or buying on dips is more prudent than waiting for a substantial correction. ""The key risks to gold in 2026 are a stronger US dollar or higher real interest rates, which could reduce investor appetite. High US inflation or strong labour-market statistics could lead the Fed to delay rate reductions, placing downward pressure on prices. A decline in geopolitical tensions or an increase in the value of the Indian rupee could also reduce momentum. If central banks trim their gold purchases after significant buying in 2025, that structural support for gold will be weaker, and the price of gold may turn more vulnerable to global market fluctuations,"" said Ross Maxwell, Global Strategy Lead at VT Markets. The Augmont Bullion  added that gold and silver prices are consolidating as rising US Treasury yields counteract support from a weaker dollar, while investors await Friday's US inflation data for hints on the Federal Reserve's policy stance ahead of its December meeting.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/gold-price-today-december-5-rates-recover-0-50-to-4-201-after-dip-in-yesterday-s-trade-check-24k-22k-18k-prices-in-your-city-13711258.html

In the domestic market, gold futures on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) rose 0.84 percent to Rs 1,30,560 for 10 grams in the morning after ending  previous session at Rs 1,29,5041. The increase in price can also be attributed to both increased demand for safe-haven assets and the anticipated increase in activity, particularly among traditional buyers during the ongoing wedding season. ""Recently, gold has demonstrated a slight strength because of the uncertainty in the global economy and continuing strong domestic demand. “Gold prices have shown a gradual increase over the past few weeks, indicating that market participants remain moderately optimistic for ongoing increases in gold prices,"" said Aksha Kamboj, Vice President, India Bullion & Jewellers Association (IBJA).

According to CME FedWatch tool data, the likelihood of Fed lowering interest rates to 350 to 375 bps has risen to 87.4 percent from 71 percent a week ago. A Fed interest rate cut typically has a positive impact on gold prices, primarily because the metal is a non-yielding asset that benefits from lower borrowing costs and economic uncertainty. Gold earns no interest, so high rates make yield-bearing assets such as bonds more attractive.

The blaze exposed layers of illegalities, rule violations, and official complacency that allowed the establishment to operate without even a fire department NOC, according to officials quoted by PTI. Sawant said early findings point to the use of electric firecrackers inside the premises. Most victims died of suffocation after getting trapped on the ground floor and in the kitchen. Firefighters said narrow lanes blocked their vehicles, forcing water tankers to halt nearly 400 metres away. Small exits and a narrow bridge made escape even harder. The fire killed 20 staff members and five tourists, including four from Delhi. Many workers were from Uttarakhand, Jharkhand, Assam, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Nepal. Police have arrested four managers of the club, while an FIR has been registered against owners Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra and the event organisers. Three senior government officials have been suspended for clearing the nightclub’s operations in 2023 despite violations. Eyewitnesses told PTI the fire may have first erupted on the first floor where tourists were dancing. One survivor, Riya from Delhi, said firecrackers burst around dancers shortly before flames swept through the club, causing panic and a stampede-like situation. Another survivor, Fatima Shaikh from Hyderabad, said people ran downstairs into the kitchen, where many eventually got trapped. Temporary structures made of palm leaves caught fire within moments, turning the space into an inferno. The state government has announced Rs five lakh ex-gratia for the families of each victim and Rs 50,000 for the injured. Arrangements are being made to send the bodies to their home states.

The airport authority urged travellers to verify their flight status before leaving for the terminal, noting that schedules remain unstable as the airline works to restore normal operations. Passenger Advisory issued at 06:30 Hours#DelhiAirport#PassengerAdvisory#DELAdvisorypic.twitter.com/hrpGxn7Oxr — Delhi Airport (@DelhiAirport) December 8, 2025 “IndiGo flights may continue to experience delays. Passengers are advised to check the latest flight status with their airline before heading to the airport to avoid any circumstances,” the advisory said. IndiGo’s nationwide operational crisis has continued to ripple across India, with thousands of passengers still facing cancellations, delays, missing baggage and pending refunds. Over six days, the airline cancelled more than 2,000 domestic and international flights, triggering widespread chaos at major airports. The airline said it has so far processed Rs 610 crore in refunds and delivered around 3,000 pieces of delayed baggage. On Sunday, IndiGo operated about 1,650 of its scheduled 2,300 flights, while roughly 650 remained cancelled. The carrier has announced automatic refunds for cancelled bookings and waived change and cancellation fees for travel between December 5 and 15. Meanwhile, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has granted a one-time 24-hour extension to IndiGo’s Accountable Manager and CEO to reply to the show-cause notice issued on December 6 over large-scale disruptions and alleged non-compliances. The officials sought additional time citing operational constraints linked to the scale of the airline’s network and multiple factors behind the disruptions. After reviewing the request, the DGCA extended the deadline only until 6 pm on December 8 and warned that no further extensions would be granted. Failure to submit a comprehensive response, the regulator said, would result in the case being decided ex parte. The show-cause notice, issued to CEO Pieter Elbers, accused the airline of “significant lapses in planning, oversight and resource management” and a failure to adequately prepare for new Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) norms. The DGCA said this amounted to prima facie non-compliance with the Aircraft Rules, 1937, and related crew duty and rest regulations. The regulator also flagged shortcomings in passenger care, noting that IndiGo did not provide mandatory assistance to those affected by cancellations and delays, in violation of passenger rights norms. As disruptions persisted on Sunday, over 400 flights were cancelled, IndiGo said it expects to stabilise operations by December 10. CEO Pieter Elbers said the airline is “recovering from the disruption” and plans to operate around 1,650 flights as it adapts to the impact of the revised FDTL rules. Major hubs, including Hyderabad, Kolkata and Delhi, saw the highest cancellations as thousands of passengers remained stranded or awaiting refunds.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/indigo-flight-chaos-to-persist-today-warns-delhi-airport-amid-slow-operational-recovery-13714589.html
113,Economy,OPINION      Time to relabel: “Indian rate of growth” is the new benchmark,"December 07, 2025 / 20:22 IST","The pigeonholing of economies through labels has been an oft-deployed descriptive tool of analysts. Most of these labels draw upon descriptive or geographical characteristics to depict an economy. Korea, for instance, stood as the strongest symbol of `Asian Tigers’, as these economies grew by leaps and bounds at a scorching pace. China is sometimes referred to as the 'Dragon Economy’, associated with one of the country's most visible and culturally potent symbols. In a similar vein, India is sometimes described as the `Elephant Economy’. There’s one label about India, however, that sticks out a rather annoying descriptor—the `Hindu’ rate of growth, something that Prime Minister Narendran Modi denounced on December 6. He saw the phrase as an attempt at deliberate distortion to link Hinduism with India’s economic stagnation during the 1970s. The ""Hindu rate of growth"", coined by economist Raj Krishna in the late 1970s, had rapidly evolved as the go-to phrase among analysts to describe India's historically low annual economic growth rate. For nearly four decades, from the 1950s to the 1980s, India's GDP growth averaged a modest 3.5% per annum. Krishna may have intended the term as an analytical observation, highlighting India's slow economic development under its then-prevailing socialist policies, especially when contrasted with the rapid industrialization and growth witnessed in many other East Asian economies during the same period. That said, what remains unexplained is the need to attach a religious label to describe the economy’s prevailing problems, which were essentially structural. The question that still remains is: why should persistently sluggish economic expansion because of structural challenges be given a religious tag? The phrase’s purpose as a descriptive shorthand for a chronic economic phenomenon continues to be seen as a commentary on Hindus, as if only the Hindus were responsible for India's economic stagnation and the perceived failures of its statist economic model. On December 6, Modi spoke of India's rising global standing, saying that even as the world faces fragmentation and uncertainty, the country is emerging as a bridge builder”. PM Modi said India today stands “in a different league”, driven by confidence and resilience. “When the world talks about slowdown, India writes stories of growth. When the world faces a trust crisis, India becomes a pillar of trust. When the world is facing fragmentation, India is a bridge builder.” The Prime Minister juxtaposed impressive figures against the decades-old economic stagnation that the derogatory label invoked, asserting that India is decisively moving from an era of aspirations to an era of achievements, scripting a new chapter as a global economic powerhouse. His address underscored a clear message: the ""Hindu rate of growth"" was a historical misnomer that failed to grasp India's true potential, a potential now being fully realized on the global stage, something that mirrors most current day analyses about India. The common thread across most commentaries about India is that the country stands on the cusp of an economic leap, poised to leverage its demographics, technological prowess, and entrepreneurial spirit to emerge as one of the most dominant forces on the global stage. In the summer of 2013, a financial analyst at Morgan Stanley coined the term “Fragile Five” to represent emerging market economies that have become too dependent on unreliable foreign investment to finance their growth ambitions. The five members of the Fragile Five included Turkey, Brazil, India, South Africa and Indonesia. Ten years later, in 2023, India moved up to become the world’s fifth largest economy, overtaking the United Kingdom, its former colonial ruler. On July 30, 2025, US President Donald Trump imposed a 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods, topped it up with another 25 per cent a few days later, and described India as a “dead” economy.  Twenty five days earlier, on June 15, 2025, India became the world's fourth largest economy. On August 15, 2025, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a bold stride into a new growth doctrine powered by `atma-nirbharta’ and next generation reforms, signalling the urgency for policy measures to accelerate growth, simplify tax rules, empower entrepreneurship, create jobs,  boost investment, and dismantle barriers to turn India into a vast market, less dependent on external factors and conditions. By 2028, the US prepares for its next Presidential elections and Trump prepares to demit office, India would have become the world’s third largest economy. The symbolisms are inescapable. The fastest growing major economy is on course to be the world's third largest. The elephant is on a rapid march. It is about time to relabel the short-hand  descriptor as the “Indian rate of growth” that stands out as the global benchmark.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/time-to-relabel-indian-rate-of-growth-is-the-new-benchmark-13714370.html

115,Economy,OPINION | ‘Fraud-stack’ can’t be defeated by front-door surveillance,"December 08, 2025 / 12:58 IST","The story begins, as many policy panics do, with a crisis. Across government departments and regulators, senior officials are staring at charts that rise too fast and fall too slowly: scam calls sweeping the country, cyber-fraud syndicates evolving faster than enforcement, FATF sanctions architecture-driven broken-KYC loopholes spawning endless impersonations, and citizens losing money at a scale that can no longer be hidden in outdated calculations showing fraud as a small proportion of transaction volumes. The question always ends with: “Why can’t we catch these people?” It is in this climate of urgency, and a lot of institutional embarrassment, that a dramatic proposal seems to be taking shape: to require all smartphone manufacturers to keep satellite-based location tracking permanently enabled, giving the state a clear, continuous view of a device’s movements. Not on request. Not during emergencies. Not with warrants. The logic is seductive in its simplicity. Fraudsters are elusive; precise tracking might help corner them. But desperation is a poor designer of public policy and always produces ill-effects even as a first-order effect. For the truth is this: India’s fraud crisis is grave, but redesigning every smartphone into a surveillance device is not a remedy. It is an over-correction so sweeping that it risks killing the very foundations of a society in the digital era. Fraudsters do not thrive because citizens can switch off their GPS; they thrive because the enforcement ecosystem meant to catch them is running on archaic machinery. Investigative pipelines still move at analogue speed in a digital age, struggling to keep pace with criminals who operate with agility and anonymity. Inter-agency coordination is uneven, often leaving vital intelligence stranded in silos rather than stitched into actionable insight. Compounding this are deeper structural weaknesses. Telecom distribution networks continue to harbour pockets of corruption that allow fraudulent SIMs and compromised identities to slip through the cracks. Bank officials often collude to open bank accounts to facilitate money laundering. Cyber-policing capacity varies dramatically across states, creating uneven lines of defence, while international cooperation against cross-border fraud syndicates remains sluggish and bureaucratically heavy. Faced with this messy, multi-layered reality, it is tempting for the state to reach for a shortcut: if the plumbing is so broken that sewage floods often, why not re-engineer the whole house and the people who live in it? The problems that cripple fraud enforcement lie within systems and institutions, not in the privacy settings of ordinary citizens. Mandating always-on A-GPS tracking would mark a radical departure from India’s surveillance norms. Today, the state must request location data through telecom providers, however imperfectly. Under the proposed regime, the state would not request: it would receive, silently, perpetually. This shifts the presumption at the heart of the Republic: from targeted scrutiny of suspects to ambient tracking of everyone. Supporters of this idea often lean on a familiar refrain: “law-abiding citizens have nothing to fear.” But freedom to be oneself is not protected by innocence; it is protected by the ability not to be watched without cause. A country that normalises round-the-clock tracking of everyone to fight cybercrime will unleash so much distrust among people that it will destroy the already fragile societal trust within communities. And what comes after is a well-known and worn lesson of history – a transition of a society of demos into that of helots. Mass surveillance may begin as an anti-fraud tool, but it rarely stays that way. What makes the proposal more perplexing is its timing. India is simultaneously positioning itself as a global force in ethical digital governance: championing data localisation, exporting India Stack, and enacting privacy legislation, at least in aspiration. How then does a nation present itself as a guardian of user data on the world stage, while considering a policy that would harvest the clearest, most intimate data of all—one’s physical movements without pause or consent? Even China, despite its expansive surveillance apparatus, does not publicly mandate always-on, hardware-level location tracking on every smartphone. To adopt it would make India a global outlier—for reasons that diminish rather than enhance its digital credibility. A credible response to fraud demands strengthening the state’s capabilities and not simultaneously shrinking citizens’ rights to non-existence. That means building modern cyber-forensics units, enabling real-time fraud-intelligence sharing between banks, fintechs and telecom companies, and re-imagining KYC given its now well-documented failures when stress-tested by fraudsters at scale. It also requires cleansing corruption within telecom and banking distribution chains, where weak points often become entry gates for fraudulent identities. Equally essential is judicially-monitored access to sensitive data—oversight that ensures the state’s powers are targeted, proportionate and accountable. And across states, cyber-policing capacity must become more uniform; enforcement cannot depend on geography or administrative luck. Inter-state coordination must work without collapsing under bureaucratic weight at precisely the moments when speed matters most. These reforms are unglamorous. They demand patience, investment and transparency –– qualities harder to cultivate than passing a sweeping secret directive. But rights-eroding shortcuts are the last refuge of systems unwilling to repair themselves, and no democracy should choose the dopamine of more unaccountable power over constitutional discipline. India’s digital future must not be built on fear —fear of bad press, fear of rising fraud numbers, fear of public outrage. Policies under pressure tend to expand state power faster than they strengthen public trust. The government recently withdrew the mandatory app-installation order after public alarm. That was a reminder that democratic course correction is still possible. It is needed again. Fraud demands tough solutions. But turning every citizen into a traceable coordinate is surrendering to the illusion that safety can be purchased by trading away liberty. India’s challenge is not to choose between privacy and security. It is to build a state competent enough not to pit one against the other. A nation state does not stay as one entity simply by fear and coercion of its citizenry. It stays as one because its citizens have the freedom to walk, travel, and simply exist without the state watching over every step. Freedom is the quiet space in which a society breathes. And it must not be switched off by switching on one mandatory GPS tracking system at a time. Mandatory phone tracking won’t stop fraud. It will only end privacy. After all, we did not rebel against the British Raj to escape becoming Macaulay-Putras to gain our freedom only to become Orwell-Putras 75 years later.

116,Economy,RBI cuts rates amid benign inflation and strong growth: The perfect hook shot,"December 07, 2025 / 07:32 IST","The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) monetary policy concluded on December 5 amid mixed market views and an extremely complex set of data. With the field set tight and bowlers anticipating an edge, the RBI played a confident hook shot for a boundary with a 25-bps rate cut. The MPC voted unanimously to reduce the policy rate to 5.25 percent. As a result, under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF), the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate stood at 5.00 percent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the bank rate remained at 5.50 percent. Additionally, the MPC kept the stance unchanged at neutral with a vote of 5:1, with one external member voting for a change in stance to accommodative. The real GDP growth was printed at an 18-month high of 8.20 percent in Q2FY26. Additionally, high frequency indicators suggest that domestic economic activity is resilient for Q3FY26; however few leading indicators are showing signs of softening. Also, the kharif crop production in FY26 is expected to be higher than in FY25 as per the first advance estimate. The downside to growth remains the uncertainty of the India-US trade deal and other external shocks. Given these factors, real GDP growth forecasts by RBI are as follows: FY26: 7.30 percent (6.80 percent) ; Q3FY26: 7.00 percent (6.40 percent); Q4FY26: 6.50 percent (6.20 percent); Q1FY27: 6.70 percent (6.40 percent); Q2FY27: 6.80 percent with risks evenly balanced. The headline inflation in October 2025 was reported at 0.25 percent, which has been the lowest in the CPI series. This is primarily led by deflated food prices. Core inflation has been over 4 percent due to heightened metal prices. However, according to the World Bank Commodity Price Forecasts, except for some metals, international commodity prices are likely to tone down going forward. Considering all the factors, the inflation projections are as follows: FY26: 2.00 percent (2.60 percent), Q3FY26: 0.60 percent (1.80 percent), Q4FY26: 2.90 percent (4.00 percent); Q1FY27: 3.90 percent (4.50 percent); Q2FY27: 4.00 percent with risks evenly balanced. On the liquidity side, system liquidity has remained at an average of Rs 1.5 lakh crore since the RBI’s last October 2025 policy. Additionally, the RBI has taken steps to infuse liquidity in the banking system by OMO (Open Market Operations) purchase for Rs 1 lakh crore in two tranches of Rs 50,000 crore each on 11th and December 18. Also on December 16, the RBI will enter into a USD/INR buy-sell swap worth $5 billion for a period of three years. During the post-policy press conference, the Governor reiterated the significance of maintaining benign inflation and ensuring effective monetary policy transmission. He stressed that surplus liquidity in the banking system is essential for transmission to flow into the real economy. The Governor reiterated that RBI is committed to providing sufficient durable liquidity to the banking system. On the forex front, the Governor clarified that RBI does not target a specific rupee level, stating: “Our effort has always been to reduce any abnormal volatility in the forex market. We just let the rupee find its correct position, correct level”. Bond Markets welcomed Friday's 25-bps cut, with the 10-year G-sec yield slipping 3 bps to ~6.48 percent. Given the overall outlook on the banking system liquidity and the Governor's assurance of providing durable liquidity, we expect more OMO purchase announcements in the early part of Q4FY26. With the 25 bps cut in December 2025, the bar for further rate cut is a little higher in this cycle, and the same will be determined by growth–inflation dynamics going forward. However, if we see the spread between 10-year G-sec and repo, the same is around 120 bps, which is higher than the last 10 years' average of 105 bps. Overall, it was a well-balanced policy, and we expect a long pause in this cycle—much like a batter choosing not to swing at every delivery after finding the boundary early in the test innings.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/rbi-cuts-rates-amid-benign-inflation-and-strong-growth-the-perfect-hook-shot-13713942.html

As long as gold stays resilient near key support levels of 1,28,200, safe-haven demand remains intact, investors seem to be pricing in a favourable macro outlook,” said Rahul Gupta, Chief Business Officer, Ashika Group. The Augmont Bullion report published on December 5, stated that gold has started its upward journey again; the next target is $4,300 (Rs 132,000) and $4,345 (Rs 133,500) with strong support at $4200 (Rs 129,000).",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/gold-price-today-rates-flat-as-investors-await-us-fed-rate-cut-decision-check-24k-22k-18k-prices-in-your-city-13714482.html
119,Economy,"Experts flag ambiguity risks in classification and capacity-based cess under tobacco, pan masala duty framework","December 04, 2025 / 20:01 IST","The Central Excise (Amendment) Bill, 2025 and the Health Security se National Security Cess Bill, 2025 have raised caution among experts over potential ambiguity in product classification, valuation, and compliance obligations. Under the bills, higher excise duty will apply on tobacco products, including cigarettes. Separately, the Health Security se National Security Cess is a machine-capacity based levy, currently proposed for pan masala manufacturing and other notified goods. Excise duty is calculated based on product category and valuation, while the cess is levied monthly on machine capacity, irrespective of actual output. Experts say distinguishing these two regimes is essential for companies to avoid misinterpretation of liability. Experts caution that the revised excise schedules may create interpretational challenges for tobacco products. “Classification disputes may arise where manufacturers challenge whether revised categories or sub-categories of tobacco products… have been correctly interpreted by the authorities. Valuation issues are also expected, especially if the new rules alter how the transaction value, retail sale price, or deemed MRP is determined, creating ambiguity in assessing the correct duty liability,” Vipin Upadhyay, Partner, King Stubb & Kasiva, Advocates and Attorneys, told Moneycontrol. For pan masala, the capacity-linked Health Security Cess is calculated based on declared machine capacity rather than actual output. Experts warn that this could generate operational challenges, particularly for smaller units or seasonal producers. “The Health Security se National Security Cess Bill, 2025 is likely to trigger significant litigation because it attempts to shift the tax base from actual production to a capacity-linked levy on machines… These areas collectively make the cess regime a fertile ground for constitutional and administrative disputes,” Abhishek A Rastogi, founder of Rastogi Chambers, told Moneycontrol. “Capacity-based taxation is rigid and does not adjust for seasonal or fluctuating output. Small units, contract manufacturers, and job-workers may face disproportionate burdens, as their liability depends on machine capacity rather than actual production… Over time, this may consolidate the sector and bring a larger share of the market into the tax net,” Rajat Mohan, Partner, AMRG Associates added. Experts also note that the revised excise schedules and new cesses could increase scrutiny by authorities, adding to compliance and operational burdens. “In the revised excise framework… valuation issues may trigger litigation, particularly on whether the ‘duty price’ principle has been correctly applied,” Alay Razvi, Managing Partner, Accord Juris, told Moneycontrol. “The imposition of a fixed monthly cess tied to declared capacity may create significant operational challenges, particularly for units with seasonal production or fluctuating utilisation rates… Companies may now be subject to stringent departmental verification of declared production capacity,” Ankit Jain, Partner, Ved Jain and Associates added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/experts-flag-ambiguity-risks-in-classification-and-capacity-based-cess-under-tobacco-pan-masala-duty-framework-13711177.html

The maiden issue of the pharma company has been subscribed 27 percent so far on Day 1. The IPO received bids for 12.24 lakh shares, as against the offer size of 45.72 lakh shares, according to data on NSE at 12 pm. Retail investors have booked 41 percent of their reserved portion, while Non-Institutional Investors (NII) have subscribed 28 percent of their allotted quota. Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIB) are yet to make any substantial bid for the IPO. Ahead of listing, the unlisted shares of Corona Remedies were trading with more than 27 percent grey market premium over the IPO price, according to data on Investorgain and IPO Watch. This has fallen from the 34 percent GMP quoted by the sites on Friday. However, the grey market estimates still signal a strong listing for the company. Corona Remedies launched its IPO today to raise more than Rs 655 crore through an entirely offer for sale (OFS) of shares with no fresh issue component. This means that all of the IPO proceeds will go the selling investors and not the company. The price band for the IPO has been set at Rs 1,008-1,062 per share. Investors can bid for a minimum of 14 shares, requiring an investment of Rs 14,868 per lot, and in multiples thereafter. The IPO will remain open for public bidding between December 8 and December 10.

121,Economy,"RBI’s forward guidance stays dovish, but offers no clear signal of a February rate cut","December 06, 2025 / 06:23 IST","First on the action taken at Friday’s policy. Contrary to our expectations, RBI cut the policy repo rate by 25 bps to 5.25 percent and kept the stance unchanged at “neutral”. Guidance on inflation was dovish as it reduced its inflation forecast for FY26 further by 60 bps to 2.0 percent. RBI preferred to use the space opened by low inflation to cut policy rates further. As was being desired by the bond market participants, and to ensure transmission, the RBI also acted pre-emptively on the liquidity front by announcing Rs 1 trillion of OMO (open market operation) purchases and a $5 billion (approx. Rs 45,000 crore) buy-sell swap for December. Inflation has largely undershot forecasts with Headline CPI inflation at 0.25 percent for October as food prices, especially vegetables, remained contained alongside favourable base effects and GST cuts. Acknowledging the same, RBI has once more revised down its inflation forecast by 60 bps to 2.0 percent for FY2,6 while the forecasts for Q1FY27 are lowered to 3.9 percent from 4.5 percent earlier. Yes Bank forecasts are even softer, with average inflation for FY26 at 1.8 percent and Q1FY27 at 3.0 percent. As a forward-looking guidance, the RBI indicated that both the Headline and the Core retail inflation are expected to remain anchored at the 4 percent levels in H1FY27. The RBI also expressed confidence in the future trajectory of India’s growth performance. The high-frequency indicators have held up well in Q3, on the back of GST cuts and policy accommodation. Rural sales of PVs, 2-Wheeler sales, and air traffic growth were all seen to be doing well in the data that is available for October. Importantly, MNREGA demand for jobs is also low, indicating that rural workers are finding work beyond the agriculture sector and the MNREGA work. With food prices low, the real wages of the rural segment have also been boosted, thereby leading to rural demand outdoing urban demand. With credit growth on the rise and with capacity utilization high, the RBI finds some indications of private investments gaining ground. The assessment of the RBI is that the external uncertainties can pose some risks to growth, but with domestic growth chugging along well, the overall growth prospects are better. This is adequately acknowledged with a 50-bps increase in the growth estimate for FY26 to 7.3 percent from 6.8 percent earlier. More than the rate cut measure, the liquidity measures of the RBI are expected to boost credit growth and ensure the transmission of monetary policy. While RBI had been performing OMO purchases in the secondary market, the markets had been looking forward to an OMO calendar for better visibility of liquidity, and the RBI has obliged. For clarity, the RBI indicated that the OMO operation is purely a liquidity tool and is not to be construed as a yield signal. OMO purchases by the RBI for December are at Rs 1 trillion (lakh crore). Further, the RBI announced a $5 billion buy-sell swap in December, implying that the total liquidity infusion into the system in December alone would be around Rs 1.5 trillion. While this measure, on one hand, provides comfort to the bond market with the RBI stepping in with incremental demand for Government securities, it also empowers the RBI to contain further volatilities in the USD/INR as needed. There is also clarity from the RBI that the operative rate for the system will be the Weighted Average Call Rate (WACR), and the RBI will continue with its daily liquidity management to ensure that the WACR hugs the repo rate. The forward guidance remains dovish, but this is no sure-shot indication of a rate cut in February. We, in fact, argue that the floor for the repo rate in this cycle has already been hit. This is because the guidance for H1FY27 Headline CPI is at 4 percent, and with the current repo rate at 5.25 percent, the real gap is low at 1.25 percent. RBI will also have to remain mindful of the interest differential between the US and India, as a large redemption pressure of G-secs in FY27 will need the government to borrow a much larger amount from the markets than in the current year. And a higher gap will be needed to ensure participation of the FPIs in India’s G-sec issuances. A new inflation and GDP series will come out in February 2026 and the RBI should be taking cognizance of the same before taking any incremental easing step.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/rbi-s-forward-guidance-stays-dovish-but-offers-no-clear-signal-of-a-february-rate-cut-13713382.html
122,Economy,"RBI raises growth forecast, keeping with trend, delivers rare December rate cut","December 05, 2025 / 16:01 IST","The Reserve Bank of India returned to a familiar pattern at its December policy meeting, upgrading its full-year growth outlook even as it cut rates by 25 basis points. The central bank raised its FY26 GDP forecast to 7.3 percent from 6.8 percent projected in October, extending the trend in which December has almost always seen a change in growth expectations. The only exception was 2021, when pandemic distortions made forecasting unusually uncertain. The December revisions typically reflect fresh data from the first half of the fiscal year and shifts in domestic demand, government expenditure and global conditions. This year’s upgrade follows resilient consumption, softer-than-expected inflation and early signs of an investment revival. “Rural demand continues to be robust while urban demand is recovering steadily. Investment activity remains healthy, with private investment gaining steam on the back of expansion in non-food bank credit and high capacity utilisation,” the Monetary Policy Committee said in its December 5 statement. Historically, the RBI has moved its inflation forecast far less frequently in December. Only two of the past five December policy meetings have brought CPI revisions. This year was one of them: the inflation outlook was cut to 2 percent from 2.6 percent in October after consumer inflation slowed to 0.3 percent in October, a new low in the current series. FY26 also marks the first year in which the inflation projection has been adjusted in every meeting since April. By contrast, there was just one revision between April and December 2024 and only two throughout 2023. Rate action in December has historically been uncommon. The last major move came in December 2022, when the MPC delivered a 35-bps hike. December 2025 has now broken that pattern with a 25-bps cut, signalling growing comfort with the disinflation trend and confidence in financial stability conditions. For most years, December has been a month of pause rather than pivot. The RBI remains optimistic about the medium-term outlook as well. It projects 6.8 percent growth in the first half of FY27. Inflation, though expected to rise from current unusually low levels, is forecast to remain anchored at the central bank’s 4 percent target through H1FY27.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/rbi-raises-growth-forecast-keeping-with-trend-delivers-rare-december-rate-cut-13712351.html

India's advertising market demonstrates resilience amid global economic uncertainty, as per a recent report titled, This Year Next Year---2025 Global End of Year Forecast. According to projected growth estimates for 2026, India is second to Brazil which is expected to see a 14.4 percent grow in its ad market, followed by India and Mexico. Total advertising revenue is estimated to reach Rs 1.8 lakh crore ($20.7 billion) in 2025, representing a 9.2 percent growth over 2024, followed by a 9.7 percent growth in 2026, to reach Rs 2 lakh crore. ""This growth trajectory reflects a cautious but optimistic outlook."" According to the report, the Indian consumer landscape presents a mixed picture. ""Household savings declined between 2020 and 2024, with household bank deposit share falling from 43 percent to 35 percent over the nine years preceding FY22-23,"" according to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation National Accounts Statistics. Despite these headwinds, consumer spending remains robust in certain segments, the report added. ""The 2025 festive season (September-October) proved exceptionally strong, with total retail sales crossing Rs 6 lakh crore ($67 billion),  aided by substantial discounts from both online and offline retailers,""according to the Confederation of All India Traders. WPP Media noted that television faces continued structural challenges, with total TV ad revenue projected to decline 1.5 percent in 2025 to Rs 47,740 crore ($5.4 billion), before returning to growth in 2026. Linear TV viewership is expected to continue declining at a mid-single digit pace as viewers spend more time online. Streaming TV represents a bright spot, projected to grow substantially from a smaller base, as per the report. ""The landscape was reshaped by the Reliance Jio-DisneyStar merger completed in November 2024, creating a dominant entity with ambitious growth plans. Amazon Prime Video's ad platform launch in 2025 adds competitive intensity to the streaming space."" The media house said that the 2027 Indian Premier League (IPL) rights auction for the 2028 cycle will be pivotal. ""The BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) is likely to increase bid prices steeply, making it a key battle between legacy TV broadcasters and digital platforms, potentially further accelerating the linear-to-digital shift."" Other digital platforms, primarily social media, represent the largest growth driver in absolute terms, projected to reach Rs 17,090 crore in 2026, up 11.1 percent over 2025. Short-form video content, particularly micro-dramas, are gaining popularity, though audience numbers remain modest. In 2026, other digital revenue will represent 35.5 percent of total ad revenue in India. Connected TV (CTV) is expected to grow in double digits as advertisers follow audiences to streaming platforms. By 2030, India's advertising market is projected to reach Rs 280 crore ($31.8 billion), with content driven advertising commanding 60.7 percent of total revenue, down from 71.6 percent in 2025 with commerce as the largest share gainer. ""Traditional formats will continue to cede consumption and ad revenue to digital formats, underscoring the fundamental transformation of India's advertising ecosystem,"" the ad firm said. Audio advertising will increase modestly, gaining 1.5 percent in 2026 to Rs 2,900 crore ($326.8 million). Digital audio formats, including podcasts, are driving growth, with terrestrial radio set to decline 1-2 percent each year between 2025 and 2030. On the other hand, print presents a paradox, the report noted. Newspaper advertising is forecast to grow 3.5 percent in 2025 and a further 4.5 percent in 2026 to Rs 17,090 crore ($1.9 billion), driven primarily by government, political, and retail-led advertising outside major agency groups. Retail media stands as India's fastest-growing advertising channel, forecast to increase 26.4 percent in 2025 to Rs 24,280 crore and 25 percent in 2026 to Rs 30,360 crore. ""This growth trajectory positions retail media to represent 15 percent of total advertising revenue by 2026,"" the report noted. The competitive landscape features Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart as the two largest retail advertising entities, it added. ""Emerging quick commerce players, including Blinkit, Zepto and Instamart, are growing advertising revenue rapidly at 100 percent rates, albeit from small bases, as they compete aggressively for market share."" Cinema advertising is recovering gradually, with an 8 percent growth projected in 2025 to Rs 930 crore. However, box-office collections remain challenged as streaming TV platforms increasingly attract producers seeking guaranteed minimum returns,eating into theatrical revenues. ""Cinema is on pace to surpass pre-pandemic levels of advertising in 2026,"" the report said.

The airport authority urged travellers to verify their flight status before leaving for the terminal, noting that schedules remain unstable as the airline works to restore normal operations. Passenger Advisory issued at 06:30 Hours#DelhiAirport#PassengerAdvisory#DELAdvisorypic.twitter.com/hrpGxn7Oxr — Delhi Airport (@DelhiAirport) December 8, 2025 “IndiGo flights may continue to experience delays. Passengers are advised to check the latest flight status with their airline before heading to the airport to avoid any circumstances,” the advisory said. IndiGo’s nationwide operational crisis has continued to ripple across India, with thousands of passengers still facing cancellations, delays, missing baggage and pending refunds. Over six days, the airline cancelled more than 2,000 domestic and international flights, triggering widespread chaos at major airports. The airline said it has so far processed Rs 610 crore in refunds and delivered around 3,000 pieces of delayed baggage. On Sunday, IndiGo operated about 1,650 of its scheduled 2,300 flights, while roughly 650 remained cancelled. The carrier has announced automatic refunds for cancelled bookings and waived change and cancellation fees for travel between December 5 and 15. Meanwhile, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has granted a one-time 24-hour extension to IndiGo’s Accountable Manager and CEO to reply to the show-cause notice issued on December 6 over large-scale disruptions and alleged non-compliances. The officials sought additional time citing operational constraints linked to the scale of the airline’s network and multiple factors behind the disruptions. After reviewing the request, the DGCA extended the deadline only until 6 pm on December 8 and warned that no further extensions would be granted. Failure to submit a comprehensive response, the regulator said, would result in the case being decided ex parte. The show-cause notice, issued to CEO Pieter Elbers, accused the airline of “significant lapses in planning, oversight and resource management” and a failure to adequately prepare for new Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) norms. The DGCA said this amounted to prima facie non-compliance with the Aircraft Rules, 1937, and related crew duty and rest regulations. The regulator also flagged shortcomings in passenger care, noting that IndiGo did not provide mandatory assistance to those affected by cancellations and delays, in violation of passenger rights norms. As disruptions persisted on Sunday, over 400 flights were cancelled, IndiGo said it expects to stabilise operations by December 10. CEO Pieter Elbers said the airline is “recovering from the disruption” and plans to operate around 1,650 flights as it adapts to the impact of the revised FDTL rules. Major hubs, including Hyderabad, Kolkata and Delhi, saw the highest cancellations as thousands of passengers remained stranded or awaiting refunds.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/indigo-flight-chaos-to-persist-today-warns-delhi-airport-amid-slow-operational-recovery-13714589.html

126,Economy,Complete customs overhaul will be next major reform push: FM Nirmala Sitharaman,"December 06, 2025 / 17:21 IST","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday said that a complete overhaul of the customs system will be her next major reform priority as part of wider efforts to streamline the economy. Speaking at the HT Leadership Summit, she said the customs framework needs significant simplification and greater clarity. “We need to make them more transparent,” she said, stressing the need to ease compliance for businesses. “There are quite a few things to do but what’s on the card — and it’s not a secret that I'm letting out before the budget — is the complete overhaul of the customs area. We need to have customs a lot more simplified for people to feel that it is not too tiresome, cumbersome for them to comply with the expectations and the rules, to make it more transparent,” she said. Sitharaman added that India broadly aligns its customs standards with the World Customs Organisation. “And we are normally in some sort of alignment with the World Customs Organisation. So every standard that they peg for us and for the world, we normally comply and keep to that benchmark,” she said. The minister noted that customs duties have already been reduced in the last two years. “We have brought down customs duties over the last two years, steadily. But in those few items where we are still considered to be over the optimal rate, we will have to bring them down as well. So customs is my next big cleaning up assignment,” she said. Drawing a comparison with earlier tax reforms, Sitharaman recalled how the income tax system once struggled with administrative complexities even when rates themselves were not the core issue. She said this had fuelled the term “tax terrorism,” something she had actively worked to eliminate through measures such as faceless assessments. “If I can just go back to the income tax act for a minute. The commentary used to be that income tax rates are not the problem. Yes, we want lower and lower and lower rates, but it is the tax administration which causes the problem. It's the tax administration which becomes painful, sometimes agonising and therefore the not so nice coinage resulted in tax terrorism,” she said. However, she cautioned that modernising customs comes with a dual challenge: ensuring smoother processes while preventing illegal or contraband goods from slipping through. She questioned whether the system could rely more on comprehensive scanning and minimise direct interaction between customs officials and cargo to reduce discretion and build trust. Sitharaman reiterated that the remaining items with higher-than-optimal customs duties will also be reviewed as part of the reform process.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/economy/policy/complete-customs-overhaul-will-be-next-major-reform-push-fm-nirmala-sitharaman-13713764.html
127,Economy,Govt to likely offload 1–2% LIC stake via offer for sale route in Q4FY26,"December 08, 2025 / 13:22 IST","The government is examining a proposal to offload 1–2 percent stake in Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) through an offer for sale (OFS) in the fourth quarter (Q4) of the current financial year (FY26), with government sources citing the insurer’s large market capitalisation and subdued investor appetite as key considerations. A senior government source told Moneycontrol that the size of the LIC counter makes a larger sale difficult in the current environment. Earlier, government discussions had pointed to a larger 2.5–3 percent stake sale through an OFS. However, sources said current market conditions and muted investor appetite have prompted a revision to a smaller 1–2 percent tranche to ensure a successful execution. “A 1–2 percent LIC OFS is feasible and should fetch roughly Rs 13,000–14,000 crore. At this stage, there is simply no appetite for a 3 percent sale, which would be nearly Rs 24,000 crore,” the source said, adding that the sale is being aligned with broader market conditions. The official also noted that the government is watching global volatility, domestic flows, and institutional absorption capacity, before taking a final decision. “We are preparing for Q4, but the exact window will depend on how markets behave over the next several weeks,” the person added. If carried out, this would mark the first dilution of the Centre’s stake in LIC since the insurer’s landmark 2022 initial public offering (IPO). Since then, the government has not sold any further stake in the state-owned insurer. The government currently holds a 96.5 percent stake in LIC. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) requires listed companies to have a 25 percent public shareholding, but granted LIC a special extension, allowing it until May 16, 2027, to reach a minimum 10 percent public stake, as it currently stands at 3.5 percent, post-IPO. This temporary 10 percent goal, set by Sebi's extension, is part of a longer, one-time exemption for LIC to eventually meet the full 25 percent norm by 2032. Investor activity in the broader market has seen a notable shift, especially among retail participants. Retail investors have offloaded over Rs 25,300 crore in equities in October–November 2025, driven by heightened volatility, profit-booking, and a preference for safer assets, even as domestic institutional investors and mutual funds continued to record net buying. This sharp reversal in retail flows has added to the government’s caution in timing the LIC OFS. Sources believe a staggered approach could prevent oversupply while still helping the government advance towards its disinvestment goals. “Investor sentiment has been fragile, particularly on the retail side. That is why a smaller tranche is safer and more practical in the current environment,” he said. Sources said a smaller, price-sensitive OFS could receive strong institutional demand, particularly from domestic funds, given the insurer’s weight in benchmark indices and its steady earnings profile. However, sustained global uncertainty and oil prices may keep foreign institutional investors cautious. The LIC counter, with a market capitalisation of roughly Rs 6 lakh crore, is among the largest PSU stocks. Any stake sale – particularly of this size – has the potential to influence market liquidity, index weightings, and short-term price movement. Given the government’s majority holding, periodic stake dilution is important for improving free float and enhancing long-term institutional participation. An offer for-sale is a mechanism through which promoters can sell shares to the public via the stock exchanges. The price is discovered through a bidding window typically open for a day. Retail investors may be allotted a portion at a discount, depending on the structure of the issue. OFS transactions help the government meet minimum public shareholding norms and raise funds without undertaking a full-fledged follow-on offer.

The rate cut and upward revision in economic growth forecast was on expected lines given the fall in CPI inflation and sharp growth in economic numbers in September 2025 quarter. The retail inflation dropped to a record low of 0.25 percent in October, while the GDP in Q2FY26 jumped to 8.2 percent. The MPC noted that headline inflation has eased significantly and is likely to be softer than the earlier projections, primarily on account of the exceptionally benign food prices. Reflecting these favourable conditions, the projections for average headline inflation in FY26 and Q1FY27 have been further revised downwards to 2 percent and 3.9 percent, respectively. ""The RBI has gone all out to support India’s growth engine, which is currently among the strongest across large economies. India has truly stood the test of tariffs and geopolitical turmoil, and we can be proud of that,"" Umeshkumar Mehta, CIO at Samco Mutual Fund said. With the USA also expected to ease monetary policy, the pressure on the Indian rupee will likely subside, thereby laying the foundation for the next phase of growth momentum, he believes. According to Sujan Hajra, Chief Economist & Executive Director at Anand Rathi Group, if inflation continues to trend below the projected path, the possibility of another 25 bps cut cannot be dismissed. Overall, the policy actions are constructive for both the equity and bond markets, reinforcing a benign interest-rate environment and supporting valuations, he said. Sonam Srivastava, Founder and Fund Manager at Wright Research PMS believes the markets are likely to read this as supportive rather than surprising since expectations for a cut had already strengthened after the recent CPI prints softened. Rate sensitive sectors like banks, autos, and real estate can see near term strength, while equities more broadly should respond positively but remain stock-selective given widening earnings dispersion, according to her. At 1:30 pm on December 5, the Nifty 50 rallied 158 points (0.61 percent) to 26,192, and the Bank Nifty soared 441 points (0.74 percent) to 59,729. Other rate sensitive sectors also reacted positively, rising between 0.5 percent to 1 percent.  Bajaj Auto has been trading within a triangle formation since September 2025, indicating a phase of consolidation. At present, price action remains lacklustre, reflecting indecision in the daily trend. The ADX reading of 13, well below 25, further highlights the low-momentum environment. A clear directional move is expected to emerge soon, for which the stock needs to give a decisive break above Rs 9,110, followed by Rs 9,250 levels. This would confirm a breakout from the triangle pattern and set the stage for a fresh rally towards the prior important resistance of Rs 9,400, followed by Rs 9,650 levels. On the downside, Rs 8,780 is the nearest support to watch out for. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 9,250, Rs 9,400, Rs 9,650 Stop-Loss: Rs 8,780  The banking sector has been one of the standout performers in recent times, with public-sector banks taking the lead. Going forward, private-sector banks are also expected to participate in the rally, and IndusInd Bank is trading near the breakout levels. The stock is currently trading above its 30-EMA, indicating a positive short-term structure. However, prices are moving within a range of Rs 827 to Rs 873. A decisive move above Rs 873 can trigger renewed bullish momentum and drive the stock towards Rs 907, followed by Rs 940. On the downside, immediate support lies at Rs 840. A breakdown below this level may drag the stock back towards Rs 827, which also coincides with important EMA support. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 907, Rs 940 Stop-Loss: Rs 840  On the daily chart, after witnessing an almost 13 percent fall since September 5, PB Fintech took support near the Rs 1,630 level and has reversed on the upside in the form of a higher high and higher low, following Dow Theory. Prices are now on the verge of giving a breakout of the rounding-bottom pattern, which is considered to be a bullish sign. A daily close above Rs 1,880 can confirm a breakout of the said pattern, which can push prices higher towards Rs 1,955, followed by Rs 2,030, with key support at Rs 1,805. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,955, Rs 2,030 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,805  Axis Bank, on the weekly scale, continues to sustain firmly above the breakout zone of the falling trendline around the Rs 1,200 level. Its position above the key weekly EMAs reinforces a positive trend structure and underlying bullish sentiment. On the daily scale, the stock has been forming a consistent pattern of higher tops and higher bottoms, indicating a healthy uptrend. Historically, the stock has shown that its corrective phases tend to bottom out around an average decline of 4 percent. The most recent pullback has also completed near this typical correction zone, suggesting that the stock may now be poised to resume its upward trajectory. The RSI, currently at 68, further strengthens the bullish outlook, signalling sustained momentum and buyers’ dominance. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,367 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,233  TVS Motor continues to display a strong technical structure on the weekly timeframe, maintaining a sequence of higher tops and higher bottoms, which reaffirms the ongoing uptrend. The price is comfortably trading above the 12-week EMA, indicating sustained bullish strength and healthy trend alignment across timeframes. From a momentum perspective, the RSI on both the weekly and daily charts remains above the 60 mark, signalling strong underlying momentum and confirming that buyers are firmly in control. This behaviour typically reflects a robust and sustained trend phase, suggesting that any dips may continue to attract buying interest. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,010 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,515  Bajaj Finance appears to be attracting buying interest lately, as it has managed to hold above the recent low on the daily chart. The price has also reclaimed the 21-EMA on the daily timeframe. The RSI is in a bullish crossover, indicating strengthening momentum. In the short term, the trend may remain positive, with the stock potentially rising towards Rs 1,150. On the lower end, support is placed at Rs 1,018, below which the stock may slip into consolidation. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,150 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,018  State Bank of India has slipped below its recent consolidation, heightening bearish sentiment around it. In addition, the stock has fallen below important moving averages, confirming a bearish trend. It appears that the stock may continue to witness significant profit-taking before any pause. Momentum also looks weak in the short term. The trend is likely to remain soft, with the price potentially falling towards Rs 921. On the higher end, resistance is placed at Rs 970. Hence, sell SBI around Rs 955. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 921 Stop-Loss: Rs 970  Consolidation is visible on the chart, yet ICICI Bank maintains a bullish bias by closing above its 10-, 20-, and 50-day moving averages. This positioning signals potential for further upside towards Rs 1,404 – Rs 1,420 – Rs 1,450 levels. A stop-loss for long positions should be placed below Rs 1,335 on a daily-closing basis. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,404, Rs 1,420, Rs 1,450 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,335  Consolidation is visible on the chart, yet M&M maintains a bullish bias by trading above its 10-, 20-, and 50-day moving averages. This positioning signals potential for further upside towards Rs 3,750 – 3,790 – 3,850 – 3,880 levels. A stop-loss should be placed at Rs 3,620 on a daily-closing basis. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,750, Rs 3,790, Rs 3,850, Rs 3,880 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,620  PNB is moving in a broader uptrend. Currently, the stock has shown consolidation on the chart. A close above Rs 120 will signal a continued bullish outlook. We anticipate further upside towards Rs 124 – Rs 128 – Rs 135 – Rs 140+. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 124, Rs 128, Rs 135, Rs 140 Stop-Loss: Rs 112  Phoenix Mills continues to display notable relative strength compared to its peers, many of which are trading near their 52-week lows. The stock maintains a higher-top higher-bottom structure, reflecting a steady bullish trend. On the daily chart, prices are holding firmly above the 20-DEMA and are approaching a potential continuation breakout. Moreover, RSI readings across multiple timeframes remain above 60, reinforcing the positive momentum and bullish sentiment in the stock. Hence, we recommend buying Phoenix Mills around Rs 1,735 – 1,725.

129,Economy,"Robust growth, benign inflation: The 'rare goldilocks period' RBI governor talked about","December 05, 2025 / 17:02 IST","The Reserve Bank of India governor Sanjay Malhotra delivered the last monetary policy statement of the year referring to a ""rare goldilocks period"" India's economy has entered as it rests on strong macroeconomic pillars of robust GDP growth and a benign inflation scenario. The governor said that the Indian economy grew at a healthy 8% in the first half of the fiscal year with inflation at a comfortable 2.2%, which is close to the lower threshold of the RBI's inflation targeting framework of 2-6%. The RBI MPC slashed the repo rate by 25 basis points in an effort to provide further ballast to India's economy that is firing on all cylinders. The fact that the retail inflation dropped to a historical low of 0.25% in October provided a comfortable scenario for the MPC to go ahead with the rate cut. The RBI governor said that the economy witnessed a rapid disinflation since the last October policy and a benign inflation outlook on both headline and core continue to provide the policy space to support the growth momentum. India's GDP growth accelerated to 8.2% in the second quarter even as global challenges galore. The drivers were India's rapidly growing consumption along with a faster momentum in services. Manufacturing also showed an impressive growth of over 9% in the July-September period. A number of factors powered India's economic growth in the first half that the RBI governor pointed at in his monetary policy speech. Tax cuts, frontloading of capex by government, softer crude prices were some of the reasons that provided a conducive environment for growth to sprint. ""Economic activity during the first half of the financial year benefited from income tax and goods and services tax (GST) rationalisation, softer crude oil prices, front-loading of government capital expenditure, and facilitative monetary and financial conditions supported by benign inflation,"" the governor said. The GST rate rationalization along with the festive push could help in keeping the third quarter growth on track. Investment activity is also picking up supported by a pick up in non-food bank credit, the governor said in his speech. India's merchandise trade gap widened in October as exports slowed while imports rose owing to higher bullion prices. However, the CAD for the entire year is expected to remain modest on the back of strong services exports and robust remittances. ""Looking ahead, domestic factors such as healthy agricultural prospects, continued impact of GST rationalisation, benign inflation, healthy balance sheets of corporates and financial institutions and congenial monetary and financial conditions should continue to support economic activity,"" the governor said. This salubrious scenario led the MPC to revise India's GDP growth forecast to 7.3% for the current fiscal year from 6.8% earlier. A softer price regime has been one of the biggest wins for the RBI's inflation targeting framework. The continued moderation in price pressure provides the RBI a supportive environment to push for growth. Both the headline inflation and the core have remained within the RBI's comfort zone. ""Core inflation (CPI headline excluding food and fuel) remained largely contained in September-October, despite continued price pressures exerted by precious metals. Excluding gold, core inflation moderated to 2.6 per cent in October. Overall, the decline in inflation has become more generalized,"" the monetary policy statement noted. Food prices, which contribute the most to India's inflation basket, have trended downwards on robust supply and the outlook remains positive. Keeping this is mind, the RBI MPC pared the full-year inflation outlook further to 2%. The 25 basis points rate cut comes in the backdrop of growth-inflation balance. The benign inflation outlook on both headline and core, continues to provide the policy space to support the growth momentum, the statement underlined.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/robust-growth-benign-inflation-the-rare-goldilocks-period-rbi-governor-talked-about-13712950.html

The findings are expected to be shared with the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), potentially widening the regulatory net around the Chinese smartphone manufacturer, a government source said. “There is clear evidence of diversion of profits in addition to fund diversion in Vivo’s case, which has tax implications. The findings will be handed over to CBDT, and an income-tax investigation may follow,” the source told Moneycontrol. Once the SFIO report is passed on to CBDT, the I-T department may examine potential profit diversion and tax evasion. For Vivo, this could translate into proceedings under both corporate fraud and tax laws. The development comes even as SFIO prepares to file its chargesheet against Vivo in a suspected fund-diversion of more than Rs 2,000 crore. The chargesheet, likely to be filed under Section 447 of the Companies Act, 2013, has allegedly identified a clear money trail and evidence of diversion of funds and profits. Sources have told Moneycontrol that the broader probe into Vivo, Oppo and Xiaomi has pegged the total suspected fraud at more than Rs 6,000 crore. Chargesheets in the Oppo and Xiaomi, also Chinese companies, cases will also be filed in due course, they said. In Vivo’s case, the chargesheet is expected to outline the minimum and maximum penalties applicable under the relevant sections of the Companies Act. The final penalty will be adjudicated by the Registrar of Companies (ROC) based on the evidence presented by SFIO. Moneycontrol has sought Vivo’s comments via email and the story will be updated once a response is received. Section 447 of the Companies Act, 2013, deals with fraud committed by companies or their officers. Fraud includes any act, concealment or omission intended to deceive, gain undue advantage, or cause wrongful loss. Penalties include imprisonment and monetary fines, depending on the severity of the offence. Penalties are imposed after adjudication by the ROC or courts. Profit diversion typically refers to shifting profits through under-invoicing, over-invoicing, inflated expenses, related-party transactions or deliberate misreporting aimed at reducing taxable income.

As the Russian President Vladimir Putin visits India, New Delhi is looking forward to increasing the trade ties with Moscow. India's total merchandise trade with Russia stands at $68.7 billion. However, the bilateral trade is heavily skewed in Russia's favour with overall imports by India comprising $64 billion while India's exports stand at slightly less than $5 billion. The bilateral trade is dominated by India's oil imports which saw a sharp increase in the last few years. India has benefited from the discounted Russian oil which has helped keep the domestic fuel prices in check thereby helping India keep a check on its inflation. During PM Modi's Moscow visit, the two nations also pledged to increase bilateral trade to over $100 billion by 2030. ""Russia is interested in increasing trade exchange. We are interested in increasing supplies of Indian products in the Russian market, and are interested in balancing trade...We are very interested in buying Indian products...,"" said Russian Minister of Economic Development Maxim Reshetnikov. India is exploring multiple avenues to increase exports to Russia. ""Increasing exports in the field of pharmaceuticals, automobiles, agricultural products including marine products,"" government sources said. During Putin's visit, multiple agreements and MoUs are expected in the field of shipping, healthcare, fertilisers, connectivity.

133,Economy,"Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | Liquid cheer for markets, a forecasting lesson for RBI","December 05, 2025 / 14:50 IST","Markets wanted it. Markets got it. This, in a nutshell, explains the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) rather dovish policy and measures today where its six-member rate setting committee voted unanimously to cut the repo rate by 25 bps after a gap of five months. Governor Sanjay Malhotra remembered that the task of the RBI is to target retail inflation and keep it within the 2-6 percent band. That means loosening the purse strings when inflation dips below the lower threshold. At rock bottom 0.25 percent retail inflation, there was no excuse for the monetary policy committee to keep rates unchanged. It would mean flirting with another explanation to the government of why they failed their mandate---this time to keep inflation above 2 percent! While a blockbuster economic growth data had dimmed the expectations of a rate cut, ironically the delivery of one wasn’t the main attraction today. The highlight was the liquidity measures that resembled a central bank walking into a bar and saying, “all drinks on me”. In a more professional parlance, the central bank has front loaded measures. The RBI announced Rs 1 trillion worth of government bond purchases to infuse durable long-term liquidity into markets and also a three-year buy-sell swap for $5 billion that will support the rupee without denting liquidity. Governor Malhotra explained in detail how market participants must assess liquidity and how short-term frictions in liquidity will be handled by the central bank through its daily liquidity measures. The bond purchases are for infusing long-term durable liquidity and should not be seen as a signal on bond yields. Also, at times, the RBI may drain liquidity through its repo auctions even as it infuses through bond purchases. All of this is fine. The bond market has got what it has been demanding for long: the RBI as a buyer to take off some supply. Yields dipped today and analysts are now pencilling in a comfortable slide to 6 percent in the benchmark 10-year segment. That would mean the borrowing cost of the government comes down which invariably will be transmitted to other interest rates in the market. This makes the job of bankers a tad difficult. After a long stretch of multiple quarters, bankers were hoping to juice out some margin improvement by avoiding a cut in lending rates. In fact, in October, the weighted average lending rate for fresh loans had risen because banks increased the credit spreads to keep loan rates from falling. With the rate cut and the liquidity infusion, lenders will have to pass on some of this to borrowers. That could put a bump into the margin improvement road. For now, this hasn’t taken the wind out of the sails of banking stocks. Dinesh Unnikrishnan explains in detail what the measures mean to the economy in this piece here. While it has been a much-needed liquidity cheer for markets, this policy is also an opportunity for the RBI to examine the health of its forecasts. The central bank revised its inflation forecast for the fifth time and brought down the projection of retail inflation to 2 percent for FY26. It changed its growth projection for the second time and now expects GDP growth to be 7.3 percent for FY26. Forecasting economic variables is a mug’s game and even though central bankers have to undertake it, the exercise has become more and more challenging and often embarrassing. Indeed, even in the past, the RBI has underestimated or overestimated inflation consistently and has done the same on growth. Its more sophisticated counterpart the US Federal Reserve is no exception. The Fed had an embarrassing episode of missing the inflationary pressures of the economy and grossly underestimating not just the extent but even the nature of price pressures. Should central bankers chuck their models and adopt newer ones? Should they just ask ChatGPT? As every market forecaster and their uncle begin to predict 2026, central bankers must clean up their models or else, join a group of shamans offering weird predictions. This FT piece, free to read for Moneycontrol Pro subscribers, explains why central bankers are resembling shamans on inflation rather than seasoned technocrats. In defence of the RBI though, the quality of economic data for the Indian economy would do well with a lot of beefing up. As RBI former governor YV Reddy said, “Everywhere around the world, the future is uncertain. In India, even the past is uncertain.” There’s a black hole where central banks’ theory of inflation should be (republished from the FT) Putin’s Delhi visit will strengthen bilateral ties Technical Picks: TCS, LTF, DEEPAKNTR, BANKBARODA",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/moneycontrol-pro-panorama-liquid-cheer-for-markets-a-forecasting-lesson-for-rbi-13711958.html
134,Economy,"Julius Baer's Unmesh Kulkarni sees rate cut pause in Feb meet, says RBI not worried about rupee's fall","December 05, 2025 / 14:34 IST","Continuing with the dovish stance spelt out in the previous (October) policy, the RBI Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) cut the policy rates today by 25 basis points, with immediate effect, while retaining a neutral policy stance. Over the past few days, market participants were divided in their expectations from the policy, with the extremely low inflation prints hinting at a rate cut while the strong growth and the recent Rupee depreciation raising the possibility of status quo. However, as we were expecting, the MPC has drawn comfort from the extremely low inflation prints and chosen to support the economy, while also announcing measures to improve durable liquidity. The MPC is quite satisfied with the growth trajectory with the GDP registering a 6-quarter high of 8.2 percent YoY in Q2 FY26, driven by resilient domestic demand (despite challenging global trade conditions), which was additionally supported by GST rationalisation and cut in Income Tax rates. The robust Gross Value Added (GVA) print of 8.1 percent YoY in Q2FY26 was driven by buoyancy in the industrial and services sectors. In the RBI’s assessment, high frequency indicators suggest that domestic economic activity is holding up, with oil prices remaining benign, the government front loading its capex and monetary policy remaining supportive; however, there are some pockets of emerging weakness. The RBI has raised its GDP growth forecast for FY26 by 50 bps to 7.3 percent, with Q3 and Q4 forecasts being raised by 60 bps and 30 bps to 7.0 percent and 6.5 percent respectively. On the inflation front, the MPC has drawn immense comfort from the CPI inflation having printed an all-time low of 0.25 percent in October, with the sharp deceleration in food inflation being the primary driver of the sustained low inflation trajectory. The RBI expects CPI inflation to remain contained, with improved food supply prospects and moderate international commodity prices. While the record-high prices of precious metals have weighed on core inflation, the non-Gold core inflation has actually moderated to 2.6 percent in October. The MPC has revised further down its CPI projection to 2.0 percent (from earlier 2.6 percent) in FY26, with 0.6 percent and 2.9 percent in Q3 and Q4. It expects the CPI to rise next year to 4.0 percent in Q2FY27. An encouraging announcement by the RBI (which was also in some way expected by the markets) was on the liquidity front. The Governor announced measures to improve durable liquidity through (a) Rs 1.0 lakh crore quantum of Open Market Operations (OMO) to be conducted in December, as well as (b) a 3 Year US Dollar-INR swap to be conducted in December. It expects these measures to ensure adequate durable liquidity in the debt markets and also aid further transmission of the rate cuts into the banking system. Our overall takeaway from the December monetary policy is that the MPC, at the current juncture, has preferred to support the economy through monetary policy action, even though there has been a significant pressure on the Rupee over the past few weeks. The MPC has utilised the current phase of extremely low inflationary conditions to cut rates further, while also ensuring abundant system liquidity (LAF: near-term) and durable liquidity, so that the transmission of the rate cuts (125 bps cumulative, so far) continues into the banking system, which will in turn support credit growth. There was not much mention in the Governor’s speech regarding the INR volatility, which suggests that the RBI, at this point, is not too worried about the INR depreciation, given the healthy forex reserves, but is watching the evolving trade tariff situation and possibly expects some improvement in sentiment going forward. The unanimity amongst the MPC members with respect to the rate cut decision is encouraging, and along with the reduced inflation forecasts, may keep hopes alive in the market about further policy support from the MPC. However, it would be prudent to think that having obliged with a 25 bps cut in this policy amid the evolving tariff pressure, FPI outflows and pressure on the INR, future rate decisions of the MPC would be more data dependent. A pause in the next policy in February is more likely, given the fact that the policy stance continues to be neutral, and the MPC might want to see improved transmission of the cumulative rate cuts carried out so far. The fixed income markets should however heave a sigh of relief, as yields had moved up in the run up to the policy. The OMOs should stabilize long term g-sec yields and keep them range-bound in the near-term.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/julius-baer-s-unmesh-kulkarni-sees-rate-cut-pause-in-feb-meet-says-rbi-not-worried-about-rupee-s-fall-13712476.html
135,Economy,"ANALYSIS      India could double exports to Russia to $10 billion, Moneycontrol analysis shows","December 05, 2025 / 16:17 IST","India’s trade ties with Russia remain well below potential. A Moneycontrol analysis shows exports could double to roughly $10 billion from $4.9 billion in 2024 if India succeeds in scaling up sales in categories where it currently holds less than half of Russia’s import market. “I am sure we will address the trade imbalance in the near future and work collectively to eliminate, reduce and dilute trade barriers if any, work to create the right conditions to open more opportunities for businesses in both countries,” Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal said at an event in New Delhi on December 4. The most striking example of under-penetration is smartphones. India accounts for just 6.1 percent of Russia’s smartphone imports, compared with China’s 73 percent. If Indian exporters were able to capture even half of this market from Chinese and other competitors, the incremental export opportunity would approach $1.4 billion in this single category. The same logic applies across a wide range of industrial materials, chemicals, machinery and consumer goods where India already has a foothold but remains significantly under-represented. Aluminium oxide exports to Russia illustrate this gap: India currently ships about $158 million worth, yet its share of Russia’s imports of this product is only slightly over 7 percent. Similarly, India’s exports of laptops and computers, worth roughly $423 million, correspond to around 32 percent of Russia’s imports—substantial, but still far from a dominant position. Pharmaceuticals and chemicals, including antibiotics, herbicides, fungicides, diagnostic reagents and various heterocyclic and amine-based compounds, typically show mid-teen or low double-digit market shares. This suggests that India is well established in these niches, but still far from exhausting the available headroom. Agricultural and food products form a second pillar of India’s expansion opportunity. Indian shipments of frozen shrimps and prawns, bovine meat, fresh and dried grapes, black tea, groundnuts and other agri items already move in significant volumes to Russia. Yet market shares in these categories often remain in the teens or the 20–30 percent range. For instance, frozen shrimp exports exceed $120 million with a market share of about 35 percent, while roughly $70 million in black tea exports translates to a share below 30 percent. In grapes, India had an 8.4 percent share with exports worth $33 million. Industrial machinery and specialised equipment also display under-penetration. Machining centres, machine tools for grinding and boring, blow-moulding machines, and sorting and screening equipment all feature in India’s export basket, but largely at single-digit or low double-digit market shares. The same pattern can be observed in higher-value segments such as aircraft parts and components, spectrometers, and various medical and surgical instruments. India and Russia have become increasingly intertwined in trade over the past decade. Bilateral trade has risen nearly 12-fold, climbing to $72 billion in 2024 from $6.1 billion in 2015.

136,Economy,"RBI MPC Highlights: Interest rate cut 25 bps, Rs 1 lakh cr OMO and $5 bn swap unveiled; GDP forecast raised to 7.3%","December 05, 2025 / 11:10 IST","The Reserve Bank of India delivered a unanimous 25 bps repo rate cut to 5.25 percent while unveiling a liquidity-boosting package that includes Rs 1 lakh crore of government bond OMO purchases and a 3-year USD/INR buy-sell swap. Governor Sanjay Malhotra said the central bank remains committed to providing sufficient durable liquidity, noting that forex reserves are healthy at $686 billion. The RBI raised its FY26 GDP growth forecast to 7.3 percent, citing healthy rural demand, improving urban consumption and strengthening private-sector activity. Malhotra described the year’s growth-inflation dynamics as a rare “goldilocks period”, with credit growth firming across industry.  MPC cuts repo rate 25 bps to 5.25% in a unanimous vote; stance stays neutral: The committee lowered the policy rate after assessing rapid disinflation and resilient domestic activity, noting that both headline and core inflation are expected to remain near or below 4 percent through 1HFY27. Governor Sanjay Malhotra said the growth–inflation alignment provides rare policy space to support momentum even as growth may soften modestly ahead. RBI launches a liquidity-boosting package: Rs 1 lakh crore OMOs + 3-year USD/INR swap: The central bank will purchase Rs 1 lakh crore of government securities this month and execute a USD 5 billion buy-sell swap to inject durable liquidity. Malhotra clarified that OMOs aim to ensure system liquidity, not to influence G-Sec yields, and emphasised the central bank’s commitment to maintaining adequate durable liquidity conditions. FY26 GDP growth forecast raised sharply to 7.3%; early FY27 estimates upgraded: Real GDP is now projected to grow 7.3 percent in FY26 (vs 6.8 percent earlier), with Q3 at 7.0 percent and Q4 at 6.5 percent. The RBI expects Q1 and Q2 FY27 growth at 6.7 percent and 6.8 percent, driven by strong investment activity, robust rural demand and steadily improving urban consumption. Q2FY26 growth print at 8.2% marks a six-quarter high and bolsters the case for a rate cut: The economy expanded strongly on the back of GST rationalisation, festive spending and benign inflation. Industrial and services sectors recorded buoyant activity, while GVA rose 8.1 percent. The print exceeded both the RBI’s 7 percent projection and economist polls, underscoring broad-based resilience. Inflation outlook revised sharply lower following a historic collapse in food prices: FY26 CPI inflation has been cut to 2.0 percent (from 2.6 percent), with Q3 at 0.6 percent and Q4 at 2.9 percent. The Governor noted that inflation has become more generalised on the downside, with food deflation deepening and precious-metal-driven pressures easing. Underlying inflation pressures are “even lower” after adjusting for gold. October CPI touched 0.3% -- the lowest on record under FIT -- reinforcing policy space: Headline inflation fell sharply as vegetables, cereals and spices saw steep price corrections. Nearly 80 percent of the CPI basket recorded inflation below 4 percent, a dramatic improvement from the previous year. This unprecedented softness delivered the first breach of the lower tolerance band since FIT began. Governor Malhotra hails a “rare goldilocks period” as India ends 2025 with strong growth and benign inflation Malhotra said India “looks back at the year with satisfaction” as H1FY26 delivered GDP growth of 8.0 percent alongside inflation of just 2.2 percent. He described the macro environment as unusually favourable despite global uncertainties, enabling the RBI to remain growth-supportive while maintaining stability. Domestic demand remains healthy; rural consumption robust, urban recovery steady: Rural demand indicators -- including two-wheeler sales and lower MGNREGA utilisation -- show improvement in farm-sector employment. Urban demand has been lifted by GST cuts and festive spending, with passenger vehicle sales and air passenger traffic registering firm growth. Investment cycle strengthens as private investment gains momentum: High capacity utilisation, rising non-food credit to industry and an 8.7 percent expansion in capital-goods imports point to strengthening investment activity. Manufacturing companies’ fixed-asset growth accelerated to nine percent in H1, signalling that private capex is starting to deepen. External sector remains resilient despite October export weakness: CAD moderated sharply to 1.3 percent of GDP in Q2FY26 due to strong services exports and robust remittances. Forex reserves at USD 686.2 billion provide over 11 months of import cover. Merchandise exports weakened in October, but the overall external position remains stable. Financial system stable: banks and NBFCs report strong capital buffers and improving asset quality SCBs’ CRAR stands at 17.24 percent with GNPA at 2.05 percent and NNPA at 0.48 percent, while liquidity buffers remain high. NBFCs too exhibit healthy capitalisation and improving NPAs, though margins have compressed due to lower lending rates. Credit flow to the commercial sector has strengthened materially. RBI flags rising ombudsman pendency; launches a two-month grievance-resolution campaign: Malhotra urged banks and regulated entities to make customer service “central to their operations”, noting a rise in consumer complaints. The RBI will conduct a January-February campaign to clear all grievances pending for more than a month and reinforce citizen-centric service standards.

137,Economy,IndiGo’s delayed preparation for new FDTL norms triggers mass flight cancellations,"December 05, 2025 / 15:00 IST","IndiGo was aware of the new Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) norms from early 2024 and had over a year to prepare before full enforcement in November 2025. Yet, the airline failed to adequately adjust crew rosters and hiring, resulting in pilots working without sufficient rest and triggering widespread flight cancellations, sources said. IndiGo is facing a severe operational crisis as it struggles to comply with the new Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) norms. The airline, which dominates roughly 60 percent of India’s domestic market, has been forced to cancel hundreds of flights in the past week, leaving passengers stranded across major airports. “IndiGo was given nearly two years to prepare for the new FDTL norms, but the airline did not implement the necessary adjustments. Pilots were operating without sufficient rest, which contributed to the widespread cancellations,” a source familiar with the matter told Moneycontrol. Sources said despite this transition period, the airline failed to hire sufficient pilots and properly adjust crew rosters to meet the stricter rest requirements. “Even with advance notice, IndiGo’s crew planning did not match the requirements of the new regulations,” a senior industry analyst said, highlighting the operational challenges faced by the airline. The phased FDTL norms were introduced to prevent pilot fatigue and improve flight safety. While the rules provided a transition window, IndiGo’s inability to fully adjust reflects the challenges of balancing rapid fleet expansion with regulatory compliance. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has opened an investigation into IndiGo’s crisis and asked the airline to submit a detailed mitigation plan. IndiGo has informed the regulator that additional cancellations are expected over the next 2–3 days as part of a “schedule stabilisation” exercise, signalling that normal operations may take several days to resume fully. On-time performance has taken a severe hit. At Bengaluru airport alone, 73 flights were cancelled, highlighting the scale of disruption caused by crew shortages and scheduling challenges.

139,Companies,Goa nightclub blaze: CM Sawant drops major clue on what sparked it,"December 08, 2025 / 11:11 IST","The Goa nightclub tragedy that claimed 25 lives may have been sparked by “electric firecrackers” set off inside the packed venue, Chief Minister Pramod Sawant has said, citing a preliminary inquiry. The North Goa club, Birch by Romeo Lane in Arpora, was bustling with weekend crowds when a massive fire ripped through it around 11.45 pm on Saturday. The blaze exposed layers of illegalities, rule violations, and official complacency that allowed the establishment to operate without even a fire department NOC, according to officials quoted by PTI. Sawant said early findings point to the use of electric firecrackers inside the premises. Most victims died of suffocation after getting trapped on the ground floor and in the kitchen. Firefighters said narrow lanes blocked their vehicles, forcing water tankers to halt nearly 400 metres away. Small exits and a narrow bridge made escape even harder. The fire killed 20 staff members and five tourists, including four from Delhi. Many workers were from Uttarakhand, Jharkhand, Assam, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Nepal. Police have arrested four managers of the club, while an FIR has been registered against owners Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra and the event organisers. Three senior government officials have been suspended for clearing the nightclub’s operations in 2023 despite violations. Eyewitnesses told PTI the fire may have first erupted on the first floor where tourists were dancing. One survivor, Riya from Delhi, said firecrackers burst around dancers shortly before flames swept through the club, causing panic and a stampede-like situation. Another survivor, Fatima Shaikh from Hyderabad, said people ran downstairs into the kitchen, where many eventually got trapped. Temporary structures made of palm leaves caught fire within moments, turning the space into an inferno. The state government has announced Rs five lakh ex-gratia for the families of each victim and Rs 50,000 for the injured. Arrangements are being made to send the bodies to their home states. Sawant said an audit of all clubs operating without permission or with high footfall will now be undertaken. *With PTI inputs",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/goa-nightclub-blaze-cm-sawant-drops-major-clue-on-what-sparked-it-13714730.html
140,Companies,DGCA grants IndiGo 24-hour extension to respond to show-cause notice,"December 08, 2025 / 08:30 IST","Aviation watchdog DGCA on Sunday gave more time to IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers and the Accountable Manager Isidro Porqueras to submit their responses to the show causes notices seeking their explanations on the flight disruptions issued on December 6. The notice was served in connection with the airline’s large-scale operational disruptions and instances of regulatory non-compliance. The official said the deadline for replies were extended following requests from both the airline executives. The two executives on Sunday had sought additional time for a response citing operational constraints due to the scale of its nationwide operations and multiple unavoidable factors that contributed to disruptions across several airports, the official said. According to the regulator, the extension has been provided as a single exception, and IndiGo is expected to file its detailed explanation within the revised deadline.  The DGCA had issued the notice after thousands of passengers were affected across major airports, with many flights cancelled, delayed or left without proper communication. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has issued a show-cause notice to IndiGo Chief Executive Officer Pieter Elbers, holding the airline responsible for the large-scale disruptions that have plagued its network over the past week. The regulator has flagged “significant lapses in planning, oversight and resource management,” placing the blame squarely on the airline’s top management. The notice, served on Saturday, directs the CEO to explain within 24 hours why action should not be taken, after widespread cancellations and delays left thousands of passengers stranded across the country. According to the DGCA, the “primary cause” of the crisis was IndiGo’s failure to make “adequate arrangements” to comply with revised staffing, duty-time and rostering requirements introduced under the new Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) scheme. The regulator said the resulting breakdown in operations reflected “significant lapses in planning, oversight and resource management,” amounting to prima facie violations of Aircraft Rules, 1937 (Rule 42A) and relevant Civil Aviation Requirements (CAR) governing duty periods, flight time limits and mandatory rest for crew. Passenger-handling failures were also highlighted, with the DGCA noting that IndiGo did not provide required facilities or information to travellers affected by cancellations, delays or denied boarding—contravening CAR norms related to passenger rights. The week-long turbulence in India’s aviation sector has been driven by IndiGo’s cancellations, severe delays and large-scale rescheduling linked to a sudden shortage of pilots and crew after the revised FDTL norms came into effect. The collapse in operations led to long queues, extended waiting hours and inadequate support at airports nationwide, prompting passengers to demand timely updates and better assistance from the airline. *With Agency Inputs",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/dgca-grants-indigo-24-hour-extension-to-respond-to-show-cause-notice-13714418.html
141,Companies,Cancelled over 800 flights on Saturday; addressing refund issues on priority: IndiGo,"December 06, 2025 / 18:39 IST","Domestic carrier IndiGo has said it cancelled over 800 flights on Saturday, much lower than Friday’s number of more than 1,000, and it is addressing all customer refund issues on ”priority”. The airline, which has been granted major relaxations by the DGCA in the second phase of the new flight duty and rest period norms for pilots, after it told the aviation safety regulator that it was facing significant transitional challenges in roster planning and crew availability under Phase-2 FDTL requirements, also said it is working ”determinedly” to bring its operations back on track across the network. ”The number of cancellations on Saturday dropped below 850 flights, much lower compared to Friday. We are continuing to work towards reducing this number progressively over the next few days,” IndiGo said in a statement. The airline’s teams are focused on stabilising schedules, reducing delays, and supporting customers through this period, it said, adding, ”We are also working closely with all airports and partners to ensure timely updates are provided to customers at terminals, on our website, and via direct notifications.” For refund assistance, the airline said, customers can visit its website or contact the customer support. Earlier in the morning, the civil aviation ministry directed the airline to complete the ticket refund process for cancelled flights by Sunday evening, and ensure baggage separated from travellers are delivered in the next two days following largescale disruption in its services. The ministry said any delay or non-compliance in refund processing will invite immediate regulatory action. The refund process for all cancelled or disrupted flights must be completed by 8 pm on Sunday, the ministry said in a statement. ""Airlines have also been instructed not to levy any rescheduling charges for passengers whose travel plans were affected by cancellations,” it said. IndiGo has also been instructed to set up dedicated passenger support and refund facilitation cells. ”The system of automatic refunds will remain active until operations stabilise completely,” the statement said. Further, the ministry said the airline should ensure that baggage separated from passengers due to flight cancellations or delays should be traced and delivered to them within the next 48 hours.

Two other persons confirmed the above syndicate of investment banks. One of them added,"" Roadshows will begin shortly and the firm is targeting a deal launch by January 2026."" All three persons above spoke on the condition of anonymity. When contacted, Biocon Ltd said in an email response - “Biocon's Board has approved a proposal to raise up to Rs 4,500 crore through permissible instruments, including equity or equity-linked securities, via a QIP, rights issue, preferential allotment, or private placement. This will be placed for approval at the EGM on December 31, 2025.

We are not commenting on the names of the bankers involved in this process.” Email queries sent to Kotak Mahindra Capital and Morgan Stanley were left unanswered at the time of publishing this article. When contacted, JP Morgan and HSBC Securities declined to comment. Incidentally, in June, Biocon had launched a QIP, raising Rs 4,500 crore, to strengthen its balance sheet and invest in innovation.

146,Companies,IndiGo flight cancellations: Airline’s size to help it contain hit on margins,"December 06, 2025 / 11:22 IST","Operational issues plaguing IndiGo, which started in early November, has led to cancellation of nearly 3,000 flights over the last 35 days. A further 1,500 flights may be cancelled over the next several days before the airline stabilises operations. Analysts tracking the company, however, do not expect a severe impact on the company’s financials given the size of operations and market leadership position. The number of flights expected to be cancelled during the December quarter will be less than 2.5% of the total number of flights during the same quarter. Before the crisis IndiGo had the capacity to run 2,200-2,300 flights a day, which takes the total number of flights in a quarter to 1,98,000 to 2,00,000. Total flight cancellations between November and now has been around 3,000. While the number of cancellations will be going down progressively, going by the company's CEO assurance of restoring flights by December 15, the total number of cancellations for the quarter is estimated to be around 6,000. Shobit Singhal, Research Analyst, Anand Rathi Institutional Equities told Moneycontrol: ""The financial impact of this disruption is not going to be that much. Going by the historical trends, there will be an impact of 5-7% on the topline on the quarterly basis only if the cancellation continues."" While there will be a hit on revenue during the traditionally strong December quarter, IndiGo had earlier announced an expanded flight plan for the winter schedule compared to the summer schedule. IndiGo increased its departures per week by 6% to 15,014 in the winter schedule, as compared to 14,158 departures per week during the summer schedule, according to DGCA data. Its primary competitor Air India announced a reduction in the number of flights it aims to deploy in the winter schedule. Air India and Air India Express have reduced the number of flights they plan to operate in the winter schedule by 3% to 7448 departures per week from 7,685 departures per week. This, analysts believe, will give IndiGo better pricing power during the period to make up for the hit on profits in the current quarter. A Morgan Stanley report on IndiGo dated December 5 stated: ""While there are rising cost headwinds, this affects the entire industry where capacity is expected to remain tight. We expect a gradual fare increase as a partial offset."" Following the decision to place the DGCA order on FDTL in abeyance, allowing IndiGo to operate like before at least for some time, the airline’s CEO Pieter Elbers said in a video message on Friday that it expects full restoration of flights between December 10-15. ""My estimate is that there will be a 7-8% hit on EBITDA. But it is also difficult to assess the margin impact because there will be no fuel cost added to the total expenditure as the planes are grounded,"" Singhal added. During the September quarter, fuel costs accounted for 27%, the largest component in IndiGo’s total expenditure. Morgan Stanley has reduced IndiGo's FY26-28 EBITDA estimates by 1-4% as better yields will only partly offset higher staff and maintenance costs. The brokerage house has maintained its 'overweight' rating with a potential 22% upside in the stock price. Citi, on December 5, too maintained a 'buy' rating on IndiGo with an upside of 21% in stock price. A weaker rupee against the US dollar and rising aviation turbine fuel (ATF) prices could pressure profits in a seasonally strong Q3, the brokerage house added.

Corona Remedies launched its IPO today to raise more than Rs 655 crore through an entirely offer for sale (OFS) of shares with no fresh issue component. This means that all of the IPO proceeds will go the selling investors and not the company. The price band for the IPO has been set at Rs 1,008-1,062 per share. Investors can bid for a minimum of 14 shares, requiring an investment of Rs 14,868 per lot, and in multiples thereafter. The IPO will remain open for public bidding between December 8 and December 10. The allotments are likely to be finalized by December 11, and the shares are scheduled to be listed on stock exchanges BSE and NSE on December 15. Corona​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ Remedies IPO is entirely an offer-for-sale, which means that the market will look at the issue solely from a fundamental perspective, that is how strong the margins are, how deep the product portfolio is, and how consistent the growth is, said Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director, Vibhavangal Anukulakara Pvt. Ltd. ""The company boasts a decent presence in the leading therapeutic areas, however, its profit figures are lower than those of some of its competitors,"" the analyst said.

148,Companies,"Step by step, we are getting back: IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers after days of mass cancellations","December 07, 2025 / 17:56 IST","IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers on Sunday said the airline is gradually restoring normal operations after days of large-scale cancellations and delays, noting that “step by step, we are getting back.” India’s largest carrier, which typically operates around 2,300 flights daily, has faced significant disruptions in recent days, leaving thousands of passengers affected. On Saturday, the airline managed to operate about 1,500 flights, a substantial improvement from a little over 700 flights on Friday. In an internal video message recorded at the airline’s operational control centre, Elbers said IndiGo is targeting an On Time Performance (OTP) of 75 per cent on Sunday. “Today, we have realised further improvements of the system in order to reach around 1,650 flights,” he told employees. He added that the airline has been proactively informing passengers about cancellations to avoid unnecessary travel to airports. “We have been able to execute the cancellations at an earlier stage so that the customers do not show up at the airport in case their flights are cancelled,” he said. IndiGo also said that 137 out of its 138 destinations remain operational as of December 7. IndiGo on Sunday operated 1,650 flights out of its usual 2,300 daily domestic and international services, while around 650 remained cancelled as the airline continued efforts to restore normalcy following five days of major disruptions, the carrier said. The airline added that it now expects its network to stabilise by December 10, advancing the earlier anticipated timeline of December 10–15. According to data on the Civil Aviation Ministry website, IndiGo’s on-time performance across six metro airports improved to 20.7 per cent on Saturday. The carrier also increased its operating strength that day, running around 1,500 flights compared with roughly 800 cancellations. The disruptions over the past few days have led to widespread cancellations and delays, impacting thousands of passengers across the country. “Following the recent operational disruptions, IndiGo confirms that we are establishing further significant and sustained improvements across our network. On Sunday, we are on track to operate over 1,650 flights, up from around 1,500 flights on Friday,” an IndiGo spokesperson said in a statement. Friday marked the airline’s worst operational day, with about 1,600 flights cancelled due to a crew shortage triggered by the rollout of the second phase of court-mandated new flight duty and rest period norms. Though the rules apply to all domestic airlines, they have now been relaxed for IndiGo by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation. The spokesperson said the airline is making “very significant” progress in restoring flight schedules and strengthening customer support systems. IndiGo also noted that cancellations were initiated earlier to ensure timely communication with passengers, adding that its teams are working continuously to stabilise operations. Refund and baggage processes are underway for both direct and indirect bookings. The airline urged passengers to check their latest flight status on its website before heading to the airport, saying, “We continue to work closely with all authorities and stakeholders to ensure a swift return to full normalcy.” *With Agency Inputs",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/step-by-step-we-are-getting-back-indigo-ceo-pieter-elbers-after-days-of-mass-cancellations-13714270.html

The airport authority urged travellers to verify their flight status before leaving for the terminal, noting that schedules remain unstable as the airline works to restore normal operations. Passenger Advisory issued at 06:30 Hours#DelhiAirport#PassengerAdvisory#DELAdvisorypic.twitter.com/hrpGxn7Oxr — Delhi Airport (@DelhiAirport) December 8, 2025 “IndiGo flights may continue to experience delays. Passengers are advised to check the latest flight status with their airline before heading to the airport to avoid any circumstances,” the advisory said. IndiGo’s nationwide operational crisis has continued to ripple across India, with thousands of passengers still facing cancellations, delays, missing baggage and pending refunds. Over six days, the airline cancelled more than 2,000 domestic and international flights, triggering widespread chaos at major airports. The airline said it has so far processed Rs 610 crore in refunds and delivered around 3,000 pieces of delayed baggage. On Sunday, IndiGo operated about 1,650 of its scheduled 2,300 flights, while roughly 650 remained cancelled. The carrier has announced automatic refunds for cancelled bookings and waived change and cancellation fees for travel between December 5 and 15. Meanwhile, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has granted a one-time 24-hour extension to IndiGo’s Accountable Manager and CEO to reply to the show-cause notice issued on December 6 over large-scale disruptions and alleged non-compliances. The officials sought additional time citing operational constraints linked to the scale of the airline’s network and multiple factors behind the disruptions. After reviewing the request, the DGCA extended the deadline only until 6 pm on December 8 and warned that no further extensions would be granted. Failure to submit a comprehensive response, the regulator said, would result in the case being decided ex parte. The show-cause notice, issued to CEO Pieter Elbers, accused the airline of “significant lapses in planning, oversight and resource management” and a failure to adequately prepare for new Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) norms. The DGCA said this amounted to prima facie non-compliance with the Aircraft Rules, 1937, and related crew duty and rest regulations. The regulator also flagged shortcomings in passenger care, noting that IndiGo did not provide mandatory assistance to those affected by cancellations and delays, in violation of passenger rights norms. As disruptions persisted on Sunday, over 400 flights were cancelled, IndiGo said it expects to stabilise operations by December 10. CEO Pieter Elbers said the airline is “recovering from the disruption” and plans to operate around 1,650 flights as it adapts to the impact of the revised FDTL rules. Major hubs, including Hyderabad, Kolkata and Delhi, saw the highest cancellations as thousands of passengers remained stranded or awaiting refunds.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/indigo-flight-chaos-to-persist-today-warns-delhi-airport-amid-slow-operational-recovery-13714589.html
151,Companies,How wet leasing helped SpiceJet sidestep strict FDTL norms,"December 08, 2025 / 09:49 IST","At a time when India’s aviation sector was reeling under widespread flight cancellations triggered by strict enforcement of new pilot duty norms, SpiceJet appears to have largely avoided the disruption — thanks to a fleet composition that keeps much of it outside the ambit of the regulations. Half of SpiceJet’s operational fleet is “wet-leased” —  aircraft operated by foreign lessors under non-Indian jurisdictions. As a result, those jets are subject to the crew-duty norms of their operators’ home countries, not the tighter domestic flight duty time limitations (FDTL) rules rolled out by the DGCA on November 1. Industry sources say this arrangement shields SpiceJet from the major roster-disruptions faced by carriers relying wholly on India-based crew, giving the airline a relative advantage as rivals struggle to comply with the new duty-and-rest requirements. On December 7, SpiceJet added 22 additional flights, including on Delhi-Mumbai, Delhi-Kolkata, Delhi-Bengaluru and Bengaluru-Mumbai routes, a day after the regulator stepped in to curb spiralling air ticket prices, imposing temporary fare caps on domestic flights.  Fares are capped depending on the distance flown, ranging from Rs 7,500 for routes up to 500km to Rs 18,000 for routes above 1,500 km. With IndiGo controlling 65 percent of the country’s domestic aviation market, the widespread disruption caused by its cancellation of 3,500 flights since the start of December, upset the schedules of other airlines, leaving travellers stranded across major airports. By contrast, SpiceJet’s mix of wet-leased planes, and a smaller active fleet has helped cushion the blow — allowing it to maintain higher schedule reliability even as the rest of the industry faced turmoil. Of the 34 aircraft that SpiceJet has, 15 are wet leased and a further four were to join its fleet by November end. The revised FDTL norms brought into effect a stricter regime aimed at reducing pilot fatigue and enhancing operational safety. The rules, implemented in two stages this year, introduce sweeping changes to duty hours, night-time operations, and mandatory rest periods. Phase II took effect on November 1, activating seven clauses that were deferred when the first phase was rolled out in July. The revised norms also increase the minimum weekly rest requirement form 36 hours to 48 hours, mandating longer recovery periods for flight crew. Airlines are required to redesign rosters accordingly and ensure compliance through internal fatigue-risk management systems. Separately, carriers must now submit quarterly fatigue reports, documenting crew rest patterns and any fatigue-related safety concerns under a non-punitive reporting structure. The DGCA said the strengthened norms bring India closer to international fatigue-management standards. The regulator has set up a four-member committee to examine why some carriers failed to accurately forecast crew availability, complete training, and recalibrate schedules despite being notified months in advance. The panel’s findings are expected to guide further compliance measures.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/how-wet-leasing-helped-spicejet-sidestep-strict-fdtl-norms-13714826.html
152,Companies,IndiGo lifts pilot hiring freeze to comply with new norms,"December 06, 2025 / 17:24 IST","Ending months of freeze, IndiGo started hiring captains and senior first officers (type rated) for its Airbus A320 fleet on the very day it secured a temporary waiver from the regulator for compliance of the new FDTL norms. The Pilots' body Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) had alleged that IndiGo had adopted a ‘hiring freeze’ despite knowing that the new norms will entail expansion of the pilot pool. On December 5, the ministry of civil aviation placed the new norms in abeyance with immediate effect for IndiGo until February 10, 2026. This came after well over 1000 flights were cancelled in a single day on December 5, the highest in the airlines’ history. Only Indian nationals and overseas citizen of India card holders below the age of 55 years, can apply for the position. The position requires a flying experience of being a first officer on an A320 family with a minimum 200 hours post line release. Applicants must have an accident and incident free record. On December 6, the airline issued a recruitment drive for A320 captains and above. Besides being Indian nationals or overseas citizen of India card holders below the age of 62, the applicants must have a total flying hours of 3000 Hours and minimum 100 hours as PIC post line release on A320 family. Another pilot body Airline Pilots’ Association of India (ALPA) in a late evening statement said that it expressed its deep concern over the temporary suspension of enforcing the new FDTL norms. “This step directly contradicts the Hon’ble Court’s directions, which mandate the enforcement of fatigue-mitigation standards rooted in aviation science. Keeping the FDTL in abeyance not only undermines judicial authority but also places pilots and passengers at heightened risk by delaying essential fatigue protections,” APLA had said. The new FDTL rules were designed to ensure safer and more humane working hours and rest periods for pilots. The one-time exemption allows IndiGo to bypass some of the stricter norms, particularly those related to night duty, with the expectation that operations will stabilize by mid-December 2025. The airline has also opened up hiring for cabin attendant (grade trainee) for female Indian nationals aged between 18-27 years. The candidate should have the flexibility to relocate at any IndiGo base. On Friday when IndiGo cancelled over 1000 flights, including all flights from Delhi and 258 from Mumbai, its one time performance, a key metric on which the airline built its marketing and public relations, dropped to below 4%. This means that over 96% of its flights were delayed. On December 6, IndiGo said it is working determinedly to bring its operations back on track across the network. “Our teams are focused on stabilising schedules, reducing delays, and supporting customers through this period. Today the number of cancellations has dropped below 850 flights, much lower compared to yesterday. We’re continuing to work towards reducing this number progressively over the next few days,”, the airline said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/indigo-lifts-pilot-hiring-freeze-to-comply-with-new-norms-13713754.html
153,Companies,"We have faced tough moments before, this is no different: IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers","December 04, 2025 / 21:20 IST","With IndiGo facing a third day of major flight disruptions, chief executive Pieter Elbers said the airline’s immediate goal was to restore operations and bring punctuality back on track. “We have faced tough moments before, but we turned challenges into triumphs, proving our resilience, strength and unity. This moment will be no different,” Elbers wrote in an email to employees on Thursday. IndiGo staff, especially the ground staff stationed at various airports across the country and cabin crew, including pilots, have borne the brunt of passenger ire over the last few days. Flyers have been stuck at airports and on aircraft for extended periods due to the disrupted schedule. The airline has seen 300-400 flight cancellations over three days starting December 2, according to estimates. “We are feeling our customers’ concerns and anxieties just as deeply. We are proactively reaching out to affected customers and helping them in every way possible to ease their discomfort,” Elbers added. Before the disruptions started, IndiGo operated 2,200 flights a day, serving close to 380,000 passengers daily. This made it the largest domestic carrier with a market share of around 65%. More than three out of every five Indians fly with IndiGo. “Given the size, scale and complexity of our network, these disruptions grow large immediately and require interventions on multiple levels and dimensions. For that, a lot of work is being conducted right now. Our immediate goal is to normalise operations and bring punctuality back on track in the coming days, which is not an easy target,” Elbers added. On December 3, Indigo announced the initiation of calibrated adjustments to its schedules. These measures will remain in place till December 5, which it believes will allow it to normalise its operations and progressively recover its punctuality across the network. “Just a few days ago, we performed remarkably well as a united team to achieve an unimaginable feat of upgrading 200 aircraft (A320s) in less than 24 hours. I am confident we all can deal with this challenge, too.

A one-way ticket of SpiceJet from Kolkata to Mumbai was priced at Rs 90,282 while that of Air India was priced at Rs 43,000, which is 15-fold and 7-fold higher than the typical fares seen on this route. The cheapest direct flight from Goa to Mumbai for December 6 was available from Akasa Air at Rs 21,600, which was more than four times the average rates on this route. Mumbai had seen 104 flight cancellations by IndiGo. Cancellation of all flights by IndiGo from Delhi on December 5, led to a spike in ticket price of other airlines. Air India’s direct flight for Mumbai from Delhi for December 5 was priced at Rs 26,000. While civil aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu on Friday said that complete restoration of services will be achieved within the next three days, following the decision to place the DGCA order on FDTL in abeyance, in a situation like this the government has the powers to cap airfares, experts say. In the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack, which took place in April 2025, the civil aviation ministry capped fares on flights out of Srinagar to ensure affordability. From Rs 65,000 the fares dropped to Rs 14,000 on the Srinagar to Delhi route after the government intervened. The attack meant evacuation of around 3,300 passengers from the Srinagar airport. The airlines were thus asked to operate additional unscheduled flights. IndiGo saw cancellation of well over 1000 flights on December 5 alone, which is over half of its daily number of flights. The airline is expecting the number of cancellations to be below 1000 on December 6. The airline expects full restoration of flights, between 10 and 15 December, its CEO Pieter Elbers said in a video message on Friday. The aviation ministry issued an order on Friday to mitigate the trouble faced by passengers travelling via IndiGo. In the event of a cancellation, IndiGo has been asked to ensure automatic full refund. If passengers have been stranded, the airline will accommodate them in hotels. ""A review meeting with the airline was convened wherein the airline has acknowledged that it has failed to anticipate the actual crew requirement under the revised norms and that significant planning and assessment gaps existed in implementing Phase-II of FDTL CAR 2024,"" DGCA said in its order constituting a four-member committee to probe the IndiGo crisis.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/kolkata-to-mumbai-flight-ticket-at-rs-90-000-should-government-step-in-to-cap-airfares-13713147.html

A class action provision allows a group of consumers with a common grievance to collectively pursue legal remedies against a company over issues such as mismanagement or fraud. The survey was conducted in the backdrop of IndiGo cancelling hundreds of flights over the past four days, leaving thousands of passengers stranded across airports as fares surged sharply. LocalCircles said the disruptions triggered a wave of complaints from fliers, extending beyond cancellations and delays. “Many IndiGo fliers raised serious concerns about refund integrity (deductions and delays), failed ‘zero-cancellation/insurance’ promises, shifting itineraries without consent, and lack of adequate compensation or support even when they missed crucial flights,” the platform said. The survey asked respondents: “Should the CCPA take up service deficiency of IndiGo under Class Action provision of the Consumer Protection Act 2019?” According to LocalCircles, out of 32,547 respondents, 87% said ‘yes, absolutely’, 3% said ‘no, not needed’, and 10% did not give a clear answer. “To sum up, 87 per cent of airline passengers surveyed want CCPA to take up service deficiency of IndiGo under Class Action provision of the Consumer Protection Act 2019,” the statement said. Many passengers who accepted cancellations — or cancelled their own bookings — reported that refunds received were “well below the fare paid,” despite the airline’s stated assurances of “100 per cent refund,” the survey noted.

The maiden issue of the popular mattress-maker has been subscribed 7 percent on Day 1 so far. The IPO received bids for nearly 27 lakh shares, as against an offer size of 3.63 crore shares, according to data on NSE at 11.30 am. Retail investors have booked 35 percent of their reserved portion, while Non Institutional Investors (NII) have subscribed 3 percent of the portion kept for them. Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIB) are yet to make any substantial bid for the IPO. Ahead of listing, the unlisted shares of the company were trading with 18.46 percent grey market premium (GMP) over the IPO price, according to data on Investorgain and IPO Watch. The grey market estimates signal towards a decent listing for the company. However, it is important to note that grey market is an unofficial market, and the actual listing may be significantly different from estimates. Wakefit Innovations launched its IPO to raise Rs 1,289 crore through a fresh issue of shares worth Rs 377 crore and an offer for sale of up to 4.7 crore shares worth Rs 912 crore. The price band for the IPO has been set at Rs 185-195 per share. Investors can bid for a minimum of 76 shares, requiring an investment of Rs 14,820 at the upper price band, and in multiples thereafter. The IPO will remain open for public bidding between December 8 and December 10. The allotments are likely to be finalized by December 11, and the shares are scheduled to be listing on stock exchanges BSE and NSE on December 15. Wakefit Innovations is strategically positioned to capitalize on the strong growth of India’s home and furnishings industry through its vertically integrated, omnichannel business model and extensive product portfolio spanning mattresses, furniture, and home décor, said Master Capital Services. The domestic brokerage noted that India’s home and furnishings market, which was valued at around Rs 3 trillion in 2024, is projected to grow to up to Rs 5.9 trillion by calendar year 2030, marking an 11-13 percent CAGR. This will be driven by organized retail expansion, online adoption, and premiumization. Master Capital Services said that within this category, India’s mattress market is projected to grow at a 10–12 percent CAGR by calendar year 2030, driven by rising awareness of sleep wellness and demand for branded, ergonomic products. “Investors may consider the IPO as a potential long-term investment opportunity,” it said.

158,Companies,"Air India, Air India Express cap economy fares as IndiGo disruptions hit travellers","December 06, 2025 / 15:35 IST","As IndiGo’s widespread operational disruptions continue to inconvenience thousands of travellers, Air India and Air India Express on Saturday said they have been proactively capping economy-class fares on all non-stop domestic flights since December 4. The move, the airlines said, is aimed at preventing last-minute ticket prices from surging due to dynamic pricing algorithms during the ongoing travel chaos. The airlines said the move was aimed at ensuring the demand-and-supply-based pricing typically used by automated revenue management systems does not burden travellers during the current surge in domestic travel. The clarification comes after screenshots of unusually high fares for one-stop or two-stop itineraries circulated widely on social media. The carriers said such higher fares often involve connecting flights or mixed-cabin combinations, including premium economy or business, which fall outside the purview of fare caps. “It is not technically possible to cap all such permutations, but we are engaging such platforms to exercise oversight,” an Air India spokesperson said, pointing out that many of these fare displays originate from third-party booking platforms. Air India and Air India Express added that they are working to add more capacity to help travellers, and their baggage, reach their destinations as seamlessly and quickly as possible. Meanwhile, the civil aviation ministry on Saturday directed the airline to complete all ticket refunds for cancelled flights by Sunday evening and ensure that any baggage separated from passengers is delivered within the next 48 hours. The directives came a day after IndiGo — the country’s largest airline — cancelled more than 1,000 flights and faced its fifth straight day of disruptions. On Saturday alone, over 400 flights were cancelled across airports. The ministry warned that any delay or non-compliance in processing refunds would attract immediate regulatory action. All refunds for cancelled or disrupted flights must be completed by 8 pm on Sunday, it said. Passengers whose travel plans were hit by cancellations should not be charged rescheduling fees, the ministry added. IndiGo has also been instructed to set up dedicated passenger support and refund facilitation cells. These teams will be responsible for proactively contacting affected travellers and ensuring that refunds or alternate travel arrangements are processed smoothly, without passengers having to follow up repeatedly. According to the statement, an automatic refund system will remain active until IndiGo’s operations fully stabilise. The ministry further directed the airline to ensure that all misplaced or delayed baggage resulting from cancellations or schedule disruptions is traced and returned to passengers within 48 hours.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/air-india-air-india-express-cap-economy-fares-as-indigo-disruptions-hit-travellers-13713688.html
159,Companies,"IndiGo restores 95% of network connectivity, plans to operate 1,500 flights today after major disruptions","December 06, 2025 / 20:16 IST","IndiGo said on Saturday that it has begun restoring its flight operations after days of severe disruptions, with the airline projecting it will operate more than 1,500 flights by the end of the day. This marks a sharp recovery from Friday, when the carrier ran just over 700 flights as part of a deliberate network “reboot.” The airline said the scaled-down schedule was necessary to reset rosters, systems, and overall network planning to stabilise operations. “The main objective was to reboot the network, systems, and rosters so that we could start afresh today with higher number of flights, improved stability, and there are some early signs of improvement,” an IndiGo spokesperson said. IndiGo also said that over 95% of its network connectivity has now been restored. The airline is operating to 135 of its 138 destinations, with the remaining routes expected to return gradually. While acknowledging that full normalcy will take time, IndiGo said it is working to rebuild customer trust after the disruptions, which have affected thousands of travellers across the country. “We would like to thank all our partners and government agencies for their constant support and guidance. Most of all, we would like to extend our heartfelt gratitude to our customers and staff for their patience and cooperation through these tough times. We apologise once again,” the spokesperson added. Domestic carrier IndiGo cancelled more than 800 flights on Saturday, the fifth consecutive day of widespread disruptions, prompting the civil aviation ministry to impose airfare caps and direct the airline to complete all passenger refunds by Sunday evening. IndiGo’s on-time performance at six major metro airports plunged to 3.7% on Friday, according to the ministry’s website. The government warned that “regulatory action will be initiated” if the airline fails to comply with refund timelines or other directives. With thousands of passengers affected nationwide, the ministry ordered IndiGo to complete refunds for all cancelled or disrupted flights by 8 pm on Sunday. “Airlines have also been instructed not to levy any rescheduling charges for passengers whose travel plans were affected by cancellations,” the ministry said. IndiGo has been told to set up dedicated passenger support and refund facilitation cells. These teams will “proactively contact affected passengers and ensure that refunds and alternative travel arrangements are processed without the need for multiple follow-ups.” Automatic refunds will remain active until operations stabilise. The airline said cancellations on Saturday dropped below 850 flights — a slight improvement from over 1,000 flights cancelled on Friday. “We are continuing to work towards reducing this number progressively over the next few days,” IndiGo said, adding that teams were focused on stabilising schedules, reducing delays and issuing timely updates through airports, its website and direct notifications. In an unprecedented move, the ministry capped fares on domestic sectors after seeing “capacity constraints and unreasonable surge” in ticket prices. The fare caps (excluding UDF, PSF and taxes) are: Up to 500 km: Rs 7,500 500–1,000 km: Rs 12,000 1,000–1,500 km: Rs 15,000 Above 1,500 km: Rs 18,000 This means a Delhi–Mumbai ticket (approx. 1,300 km) is capped at Rs 18,000. The order applies to all bookings — airline websites and online travel agents. Business class and UDAN flights are exempt. The ministry will monitor fares in real time and warned: “Any deviation from the prescribed norms will attract immediate corrective action.” Before the cap took effect, some routes were quoting exorbitant fares. A one-stop SpiceJet Kolkata–Mumbai ticket for December 6 was priced as high as ₹90,000, while an Air India Mumbai–Bhubaneswar ticket was seen at Rs 84,485. Industry bodies welcomed the move. IATO President Ravi Gosain said unpredictable spikes “damage consumer confidence,” while FAITH board member Anil Kalsi called the cap “essential to protect flyer rights.” IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers broke his silence on Friday, apologising for the inconvenience and saying the airline expected fewer than 1,000 cancellations on Saturday. The DGCA has temporarily relaxed certain pilot duty norms to help IndiGo manage crew shortages, including rolling back the night-duty definition to 12 am–5 am and allowing six night landings instead of two. The Airlines’ Pilots Association (ALPA) India strongly criticised the DGCA’s decision, calling the relaxations “selective and unsafe.” “This has not just destroyed regulatory parity but also placed millions of passengers at heightened risk,” ALPA India said, urging authorities to uphold court-mandated fatigue norms. IndiGo was the first to oppose the new FDTL norms introduced in 2024, which require longer rest periods and limit night landings.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/indigo-restores-95-of-network-connectivity-plans-to-operate-1-500-flights-today-after-major-disruptions-13713865.html
160,Companies,IndiGo’s big stumble: Decoding the factors shaking India’s top airline,"December 07, 2025 / 15:32 IST","IndiGo – the airline that once redefined punctuality and scale in India – cancelled hundreds of flights nationwide, undone by its biggest operational crisis yet: a potent mix of misjudged pilot requirements under new rules and a risky ”lean-staffing” or ”buffer-deficit” model. Regulatory changes to pilot duty-time limits, combined with tight staffing and an aggressive winter schedule, exposed deep cracks in IndiGo’s crew-planning model this month. The airline’s use-every-aircraft, maximise-night-flying strategy – the backbone of its low-cost dominance – collapsed as large segments of its pilot roster were pushed into mandatory rest periods. India’s largest airline has been for the past six days cancelling hundreds of flights, including more than 650 on Sunday out of around 2,300 daily flights it operates, throwing travel plans into disarray for tens of thousands of passengers.The disruption left many missing critical meetings, job interviews and even their own wedding receptions, while some stranded travellers were reportedly dealing with medical emergencies.With IndiGo commanding over 65 per cent of India’s domestic market, the disruptions set off a nationwide domino effect, overwhelming airports and leaving rival carriers unable to absorb the surge of displaced travellers. Terminals were flooded with desperate, angry passengers, while thousands of pieces of baggage lay strewn across arrival and departure halls.Regulators have stepped in, arguably belatedly, with fare caps, advisories and oversight, while the airline has rolled out fee waivers, refunds and a phased restoration plan. The steps in the near-duopoly market – IndiGo and Tata Group-owned Air India control over 91 per cent of the market share – will take time to restore normalcy. TRIGGER: The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) introduced revised Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) rules in phases, with full enforcement by November 1, 2025, to combat pilot fatigue and align Indian aviation with global safety standards.Under the new rules, weekly rest for pilots was raised from 36 to 48 hours; weekly number of landings a pilot can make from midnight to early morning cut to two from six earlier, maximum time pilots can fly in flights that stretch into the night capped at 10 hours, no more than two consecutive night duties and night flights defined more tightly (00.00 – 06.00 instead of earlier 00.00 – 05.00) – all of which dramatically reduced the number of flights a pilot can operate per week.DGCA had originally notified the revised limits in January 2024. The revised rules were notified with immediate effect on May 31 last year, with airlines initially required to comply by June 1, 2024, but their implementation was deferred to a phased roll-out starting July 1, 2025, and completing by November 1 this year. POOR PLANNING: IndiGo reportedly underestimated how many additional pilots were needed under the new rules. For its large Airbus A320 fleet, IndiGo said it needed over 2,422 captains to operate smoothly, but had only 2,357 and a similar shortfall among first officers.Also, adding to the problems was IndiGo’s ”lean-staffing” or ”buffer-deficit” strategy – limited pilot hiring, thin roster reserves and an operating model heavily reliant on night flights and high aircraft utilisation. That formula worked under the old rules, but it left the airline with virtually no cushion once stricter crew-rest requirements kicked in. CANCELLATIONS: Mass flight cancellations were reported first on December 2.On December 3, at least 150 flights were cancelled, spread across Delhi, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Mumbai. And chaos only escalated thereafter.Major airports – Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad, among others – turned into scenes of chaos: long queues, stranded passengers, missing baggage, cancellations even after boarding or check-in, and very poor communication from airline staff.For thousands of passengers, the disruption was far more than an inconvenience: missed weddings, business meetings and medical emergencies, alongside costly last-minute rebookings and days of uncertainty with no clear timelines. INITIAL AIRLINE RESPONSE: IndiGo acknowledged widespread problems for the first time on December 3, and attributed it to a multitude of factors – minor technology glitches, schedule changes linked to the winter season, adverse weather conditions, increased congestion in the aviation system and implementation of updated crew rostering rules (Flight Duty Time Limitations).The airline said all these factors worked together to have a ”negative compounding impact on our operations in a way that was not feasible to be anticipated”.IndiGo also said it would provide refunds or alternate travel arrangements.It said the cancellations arose primarily from ”misjudgment and planning gaps”. BOOKINGS: Despite problems taking root, IndiGo continued to take fresh bookings for same-day and near-future flights and checked-in passengers, later informing them that the flights were delayed and communicating cancellation after hours of wait at the airport.Even after six days, IndiGo does not provide a clear status of flights it is operating during the day or the ones that are cancelled. It is left to passengers to find out if their flights are scheduled or cancelled, often after they reach the airport. APOLOGY: The airline officially apologised to passengers on December 4, following three days of long airport queues and stranded travellers left waiting for flights that never took off.The next day, IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers issued an apology and outlined three lines of action to solve the crisis, expecting the airline to ”return to a full, normal operation” between December 10 and 15.On Sunday, IndiGo said it will operate 1,650 out of around 2,300 flights and expects to stabilise operations by December 10.IndiGo had also announced several measures to support the affected passengers – full refunds for all cancelled flights, processed automatically to the original mode of payment; complete waiver on cancellation and rescheduling fees for travel between December 5 and December 15, 2025; hotel rooms and ground transport arranged across cities for stranded passengers; complimentary meals and snacks to be provided at airports; and lounge access for senior citizens, wherever possible. RULES SUSPENDED: Facing public outrage and massive disruption, DGCA on December 5 granted a temporary one-time exemption for IndiGo’s A320 fleet from certain night-duty and night-landing restrictions, effective until February 10, 2026.At the same time, DGCA has opened a formal inquiry. IndiGo must submit fortnightly progress reports on crew utilisation, propose a concrete roadmap to plug staffing gaps, and generally rebuild its roster resiliency. FARE CAPS: The crisis at IndiGo led to a surge in domestic airfares across several important cities. For example, the cheapest fare for December 6 for a Delhi to Bengaluru flight crossed Rs 40,000, with some options exceeding Rs 80,000. Minimum fare for Delhi-Mumbai touched Rs 36,107, with the highest over Rs 56,000. Last-minute fare for Delhi-Chennai surged to Rs 62,00-Rs 82,000.The government stepped in on December 6, capping fares. The Ministry of Civil Aviation ordered all airlines to maintain strict adherence to prescribed fare caps. SHOWCAUSE: DGCA on December 6 issued show-cause notices to IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers and Accountable Manager Isidro Porqueras, seeking explanations within 24 hours on the massive flight disruptions.The notices mentioned that the primary cause of the flight disruptions is the non-provisioning of adequate arrangements to cater to the revised requirements for smooth implementation of the approved FDTL scheme for the airline. BOARD COMMITTEE: IndiGo on Sunday said its board of directors has set up a Crisis Management Group (CMG) comprising its chairman Vikram Singh Mehta and directors Gregg Saretsky, Mike Whitaker, and Amitabh Kant.CEO Pieter Elbers is also part of the group that has been meeting regularly to monitor the situation and is being constantly updated by the management on the measures being undertaken to restore normal operations.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/indigo-s-big-stumble-decoding-the-factors-shaking-india-s-top-airline-13714215.html
161,Companies,IndiGo's flight chaos: Why the airline was hit hardest,"December 04, 2025 / 17:26 IST","IndiGo cancelled an estimated 500 flights on Tuesday and Wednesday (December 2 and 3) as the airline, which flies three out of five Indians, struggled to maintain its flying schedule. The sudden disruption spilt over to Thursday, with many flights standing cancelled, leading to chaotic scenes at airports. Among other reasons, IndiGo has blamed the Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) norms for the shortage in crew to operate the flights. In fact, the implementation of the FDTL norms from November 1 emerged as the biggest reason for the flight cancellations that month. According to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), of the 1,232 flights cancelled by IndiGo in November, 61% or 755 cancellations were due to FDTL constraints. FDTL is designed to reduce fatigue and improve safety. The new norms required overhauls to duty schedules, night-landing plans and weekly rest charts. The government had given airlines two years to adapt to the new FDTL rules. Experts said that IndiGo failed to comprehensively plan its winter schedule in the face of the FDTL norms. IndiGo’s competition, however, is sitting on better ground. Air India and Air India Express have reduced the number of flights they plan to operate in the winter schedule by 3%. From 7,685 departures per week, the Tata group airlines would be operating 7,448 departures per week during the winter schedule. Air India has also scaled back international flights over the last several months. This has allowed both the airlines, which control 27% of the domestic aviation market, to have relatively better availability of flight crews. Ajay Singh-promoted SpiceJet has increased its winter departures per week by 26% to 1,568 compared to its summer schedule. But for the low-cost (LCC) airline, since around 50% of its fleet is wet leased, it is not majorly impacted by the new FDTL norms. Akasa Air, the Jhunjhunwala family-promoted, Mumbai-based low-cost airline, had an excess number of pilots in its pool. Though there was a significant delay in Boeing's supply of new aircraft, Akasa continued to recruit new pilots, which has helped it maintain pilot availability. IndiGo increased its departures per week by 6% to 15,014 in the winter schedule, as compared to 14,158 departures per week during the summer schedule, according to DGCA data. The increase had to come on the back of the implementation of the FDTL norms. Aviation professional Shakti Lumba said, “Indigo has maximum night flight operations in the country, much more than Air India. IndiGo policy as LCC provides for a lean pilot work force with high utilisation for maximum duty time (up to limits) and minimum legal rest. Consequently, their flight schedule has caused a shortage of pilots due to night operation restrictions and increased rest to address pilot fatigue.”",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/indigo-s-flight-chaos-why-the-airline-was-hit-hardest-13711033.html
162,Companies,Ceat looks to strengthen global play; focuses on developing tyres to suit different markets,"December 07, 2025 / 12:35 IST","Tyre maker Ceat is developing tyres for various global markets as it aims to expand its exports to regions like Europe and US with plans to establish itself as a global brand, according to RPG Group Vice Chairman Anant Goenka. The RPG Group firm garners around 20 per cent of its revenues from exports and expects the contribution to grow over the next few years. ""We are focusing a lot on international growth — in the US, growth in the EU. Our goal is to become a global brand. We often say that industry in India can do more to develop and invest more in brands, invest in global growth and so on. So that's one area of focus for us,"" Goenka told PTI during an interaction. He noted that the company is focussing on developing tyres on specific requirements of a region. ""What is the customer need in Italy, what is the customer need in Spain, we are developing an entire range of tyres for that specific market. It could be for the wine growing region, it could be for certain weather conditions in those countries,"" Goenka, who recently took over as FICCI President, stated. The company is testing tyres in the Nordic region, in Germany, in different areas, Goenka said. ""We make tyres for specific road conditions. So in the Middle East, the cars go on straight roads. In Europe, there are curved roads. In the US, they have straight roads. The weather conditions are also different, so you have to develop tyres keeping all this in mind,"" he said. Goenka said the tyre maker remains very optimistic about growth prospects going ahead. ""We are finding ourselves short on capacity. We sell about 60 per cent in the replacement market, 20 per cent internationally, and 20-25 per cent to OEMs. So to that extent, all sectors are looking fairly positive,"" he noted. On the overall domestic tyre segment, Goenka said overall the future looks fairly positive. ""Raw material prices have been largely flat. Rubber is at about Rs 185 per kg today. Crude has been at $60 per barrel. That's the key raw material basket that we have. So to that extent, the outlook is also fairly positive from the demand side as well as raw material and margin side,"" Goenka said. He noted that the company is looking at consolidating the Camso acquisition and converting it into a strategic advantage by making sure the capacity utilisation is good. ""We are leveraging the brand effectively. We are maintaining the premiumness of the brand,"" Goenka said.

163,Companies,DGCA's FDTL relaxation to IndiGo could open the door for rival airlines,"December 05, 2025 / 15:25 IST","India’s aviation regulator may face pressure from multiple airlines over the recently implemented flight duty time limitations (FDTL) norms, with industry sources indicating that more carriers are preparing to approach the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) for relief if IndiGo’s request is considered favourably. DGCA on December 5, granted a temporary one-time exemption to IndiGo for A320 fleet operations for specific provisions of the revised FDTL norms. These are for night duty and for operations encroaching night duty. ""The exemption is granted solely to facilitate operational stabilization and shall not be construed as dilution of safety requirements,"" DGCA said in its directive. The exemption shall remain valid up to February 10, 2026, and shall be subject to mandatory review every 15 days based on the operational data and compliances reports submitted by the airlines. Within 30 days Indigo shall submit a roadmap for full compliance with FDTL, including timelines to achieve 100% adherence. On December 4, the DGCA had directed IndiGo to submit a detailed proposal outlining the specific relaxations it requires to normalise flight operations. The airline has been forced to scale back parts of its network in recent weeks as the new fatigue-management rules—covering rest periods, night-duty windows and cumulative flying limits—have constrained crew availability and disrupted rotations. According to people familiar with the matter, Air India and Air India Express have also decided to approach the DGCA seeking temporary flexibility in implementing the norms. Executives say that if FDTL relaxations are granted to the country’s largest airline, other carriers will naturally seek equal treatment to maintain competitive parity. “It cannot be that the norms get relaxed for just one company. It is natural for other airlines to ask for the same to make it fair for everyone,” said an executive at a leading airline, requesting anonymity because the discussions are not public. While the two Tata-owned carriers are preparing formal submissions, the situation varies across the sector. Akasa Air, according to industry sources, has not faced operational disruption so far under the revised rules. The airline’s crew rostering model and stage lengths have allowed it to remain compliant without major schedule changes, and it has not taken any decision on seeking relaxation. SpiceJet is unlikely to be materially impacted either. Close to half of the carrier’s fleet is currently wet-leased, meaning the foreign operators flying those aircraft are governed by their own jurisdictions’ crew regulations. As a result, the FDTL framework applied to Indian carriers has limited bearing on SpiceJet’s day-to-day operations, and the airline is expected to remain neutral on the question of whether the DGCA should ease norms. Sector executives say that if the regulator grants any concessions, it will have to ensure a level playing field. Carriers argue that uneven application of duty-time rules would distort scheduling flexibility, cost structures and route planning at a time when airlines are operating with tight capacity and high utilisation. As per IndiGo's submissions with the DGCA earlier, the disruptions at the airline have arisen primarily from misjudgment and planning gaps in implementing Phase 2 of the FDTL CAR, with the airline accepting that the actual crew requirement for the new CAR exceeded their anticipation. From December 8 onwards, IndiGo will reduce its flight operations to minimize disruption. For now, DGCA officials have maintained that safety-linked provisions are non-negotiable, though they have left the door open for operational feedback and structured submissions from airlines. The regulator is expected to examine IndiGo’s proposal once submitted, but any relaxation is likely to trigger follow-on requests from other carriers seeking comparable treatment. The coming weeks may therefore test the balance between fatigue management and operational flexibility in Indian aviation, with the DGCA weighing industry concerns against the broader regulatory shift toward stricter safety oversight.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/dgca-s-fdtl-relaxation-to-indigo-could-open-the-door-for-rival-airlines-13712377.html
164,Companies,DGCA’s notice against IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers puts focus on foreign executives in Indian airlines: Report,"December 07, 2025 / 19:03 IST","The Centre’s authority to influence or block the continuation of foreign nationals in top airline leadership roles has come under renewed scrutiny following the DGCA’s show-cause notice to IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers amid the nationwide flight crisis, News18 reported. Under India’s civil aviation framework, foreign nationals appointed to sensitive senior positions, such as CEO, accountable manager or COO, must secure security clearance from the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). Without this mandatory clearance, airlines cannot appoint or retain such executives in key roles. Although the exact Civil Aviation Requirements (CAR) differ across operator categories, the overarching rule is uniform: foreign nationals in top management must possess valid MHA security clearance at the time of appointment, failing which they cannot assume charge. Past instances in the aviation sector have shown that outcomes of these clearances can shape leadership structures in Indian carriers. The scrutiny intensified after the Directorate General of Civil Aviation issued a show-cause notice to Pieter Elbers dated December 6, 2025. The regulator cited major disruptions in IndiGo’s operations, noting: “Whereas it has been observed that scheduled flights of M/s IndiGo Airlines have recently faced massive disruptions resulting in severe inconvenience, hardship and distress to passengers…” The notice linked the disruptions to gaps in operational planning. “Whereas it has also been noticed that the primary cause of said flight disruptions is non-provisioning of adequate arrangements to cater to the revised requirements for smooth implementation of the approved FDTL (flight duty time limitations) scheme for the airline,” it said. It further pointed to “significant lapses” in oversight. “Whereas such large-scale operational failures indicate significant lapses in planning, oversight, and resource management, and is prima facie non-compliance on the part of the airline…” the notice stated, placing responsibility directly on the CEO. “Whereas, as the CEO, you are responsible for ensuring effective management of the airlines but you have failed in your duty to ensure timely arrangements for conduct of reliable operations…” Elbers has been given 24 hours to respond, a timeline that is standard when the DGCA assesses whether leadership failures might require regulatory escalation or review of an executive’s eligibility for a key post. If the DGCA deems Elbers’ response inadequate, the matter could be escalated to the civil aviation ministry, which may then seek a review of the CEO’s MHA security clearance — a prerequisite for all foreign nationals in sensitive aviation roles. While no foreign airline CEO in India has been removed mid-tenure due to withdrawal of this clearance, the requirement remains a critical gatekeeper, and its revocation could, in theory, prevent continuation in the role. Industry officials note that though foreign executives undergo deeper scrutiny, Indian nationals in sensitive roles may also face MHA assessments when necessary. Indian aviation has seen several cases where MHA security clearance influenced leadership appointments or operational decision-making. At Jet Airways during 2018–19, clearance-related issues surrounding foreign executives reportedly complicated senior-level changes. At AirAsia India, multiple foreign nominees awaited MHA approval before formally taking charge, with interim Indian leadership stepping in until clearances were granted. In the pre-privatisation phase of Air India, some foreign experts proposed for operational roles never joined due to delays or denials in security clearance. These instances make clear that, even though removal through clearance withdrawal has not been publicly recorded, the MHA’s approval has consistently shaped who can or cannot occupy top positions in Indian airlines. *With Agency Inputs",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/dgca-s-notice-against-indigo-ceo-pieter-elbers-puts-focus-on-foreign-executives-in-indian-airlines-13714324.html

166,Companies,"India, US investigators to review key data next week in Air India 787 crash case","December 06, 2025 / 19:36 IST","India is sending investigators to the US next week to go over data with the National Transportation Safety Board gathered so far on the deadly crash in June of an Air India flight. The Indian investigators plan to share their findings, including any information gleaned from the plane’s cockpit voice and flight data recorders, according to a person familiar with the meeting. India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau has been leading the probe into crash, which killed 241 passengers and crew on the ill-fated Boeing Co. 787 Dreamliner. The meeting will occur at the NTSB’s headquarters in Washington, the person said on the condition of anonymity because the information isn’t public. Representatives from other parties to the investigation, including Boeing, will also be present, the person said. A spokesperson for the NTSB said it didn’t have any information to provide at this time and referred questions to Indian authorities. Boeing referred all questions to AAIB. AAIB and India’s aviation ministry didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment over the weekend. The meeting between the Indian and US investigators comes after reports of tension between the two countries over the handling of the crash probe. Meanwhile, pilots’ unions in India have pushed back against any suggestions that the crash was caused by pilot action. The preliminary report showed the aircraft’s fuel-control switches were turned off immediately after the plane departed from an airport in Ahmedabad, causing the engines to lose power and dooming the flight. Although the move was reversed about 10 seconds later, it was too late to avert the tragedy. Investigators are still compiling information and no final conclusions have been reached in the probe.

The immediate focus, he said, is on stabilising services, with full normalisation expected by December 10. Even as inadequate crew planning under the revised flight duty norms has been flagged as a major reason for the chaos, the official insisted the airline has sufficient pilots. “Our pilot numbers are fine while we may not have the luxury of having a buffer,” he said, denying any shortage. He also dismissed speculation about a hiring freeze, stating that IndiGo continues to recruit and that its lean operating model is not responsible for the current crisis. After five days of widespread cancellations, the situation is gradually improving. IndiGo, which typically operates around 2,300 daily flights, expects to run 1,650 flights on Sunday, up from 1,500 on Saturday. The official said the disruptions stemmed from multiple triggers. “We will need a root cause analysis… the disruptions happened due to a combination of factors and which factor played how much role (will be known after the analysis),” he noted, calling the episode a significant learning experience. The second phase of the Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) norms, effective November 1, has reduced the number of night landings that pilots can undertake, tightening cockpit availability across airlines. While other carriers have not faced disruptions of this scale, the official said they “had a better buffer than IndiGo in terms of the number of pilots.” He added, “But that does not mean that there is a question of inadequacy, no.” The DGCA has issued show-cause notices to IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers and Accountable Manager Isidro Porqueras, seeking explanations for the widespread operational failures. On whether the chaos could have been avoided, the official said, “We will do our root cause analysis… and then we will come to know (what was the) planning lapse, if at all.” As the fog season approaches, the airline expressed confidence in its preparedness, saying it has adequate aircraft and crew to navigate winter disruptions.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/indigo-denies-pilot-crunch-begins-deep-dive-into-recent-flight-chaos-13714390.html

The maiden issue of the pharma company has been subscribed 27 percent so far on Day 1. The IPO received bids for 12.24 lakh shares, as against the offer size of 45.72 lakh shares, according to data on NSE at 12 pm. Retail investors have booked 41 percent of their reserved portion, while Non-Institutional Investors (NII) have subscribed 28 percent of their allotted quota. Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIB) are yet to make any substantial bid for the IPO. Ahead of listing, the unlisted shares of Corona Remedies were trading with more than 27 percent grey market premium over the IPO price, according to data on Investorgain and IPO Watch. This has fallen from the 34 percent GMP quoted by the sites on Friday. However, the grey market estimates still signal a strong listing for the company. Corona Remedies launched its IPO today to raise more than Rs 655 crore through an entirely offer for sale (OFS) of shares with no fresh issue component. This means that all of the IPO proceeds will go the selling investors and not the company. The price band for the IPO has been set at Rs 1,008-1,062 per share. Investors can bid for a minimum of 14 shares, requiring an investment of Rs 14,868 per lot, and in multiples thereafter. The IPO will remain open for public bidding between December 8 and December 10.

170,Tech,Goa nightclub blaze: CM Sawant drops major clue on what sparked it,"December 08, 2025 / 11:11 IST","The Goa nightclub tragedy that claimed 25 lives may have been sparked by “electric firecrackers” set off inside the packed venue, Chief Minister Pramod Sawant has said, citing a preliminary inquiry. The North Goa club, Birch by Romeo Lane in Arpora, was bustling with weekend crowds when a massive fire ripped through it around 11.45 pm on Saturday. The blaze exposed layers of illegalities, rule violations, and official complacency that allowed the establishment to operate without even a fire department NOC, according to officials quoted by PTI. Sawant said early findings point to the use of electric firecrackers inside the premises. Most victims died of suffocation after getting trapped on the ground floor and in the kitchen. Firefighters said narrow lanes blocked their vehicles, forcing water tankers to halt nearly 400 metres away. Small exits and a narrow bridge made escape even harder. The fire killed 20 staff members and five tourists, including four from Delhi. Many workers were from Uttarakhand, Jharkhand, Assam, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Nepal. Police have arrested four managers of the club, while an FIR has been registered against owners Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra and the event organisers. Three senior government officials have been suspended for clearing the nightclub’s operations in 2023 despite violations. Eyewitnesses told PTI the fire may have first erupted on the first floor where tourists were dancing. One survivor, Riya from Delhi, said firecrackers burst around dancers shortly before flames swept through the club, causing panic and a stampede-like situation. Another survivor, Fatima Shaikh from Hyderabad, said people ran downstairs into the kitchen, where many eventually got trapped. Temporary structures made of palm leaves caught fire within moments, turning the space into an inferno. The state government has announced Rs five lakh ex-gratia for the families of each victim and Rs 50,000 for the injured. Arrangements are being made to send the bodies to their home states. Sawant said an audit of all clubs operating without permission or with high footfall will now be undertaken. *With PTI inputs",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/goa-nightclub-blaze-cm-sawant-drops-major-clue-on-what-sparked-it-13714730.html

The maiden issue of the popular mattress-maker has been subscribed 7 percent on Day 1 so far. The IPO received bids for nearly 27 lakh shares, as against an offer size of 3.63 crore shares, according to data on NSE at 11.30 am. Retail investors have booked 35 percent of their reserved portion, while Non Institutional Investors (NII) have subscribed 3 percent of the portion kept for them. Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIB) are yet to make any substantial bid for the IPO. Ahead of listing, the unlisted shares of the company were trading with 18.46 percent grey market premium (GMP) over the IPO price, according to data on Investorgain and IPO Watch. The grey market estimates signal towards a decent listing for the company. However, it is important to note that grey market is an unofficial market, and the actual listing may be significantly different from estimates. Wakefit Innovations launched its IPO to raise Rs 1,289 crore through a fresh issue of shares worth Rs 377 crore and an offer for sale of up to 4.7 crore shares worth Rs 912 crore. The price band for the IPO has been set at Rs 185-195 per share. Investors can bid for a minimum of 76 shares, requiring an investment of Rs 14,820 at the upper price band, and in multiples thereafter. The IPO will remain open for public bidding between December 8 and December 10. The allotments are likely to be finalized by December 11, and the shares are scheduled to be listing on stock exchanges BSE and NSE on December 15. Wakefit Innovations is strategically positioned to capitalize on the strong growth of India’s home and furnishings industry through its vertically integrated, omnichannel business model and extensive product portfolio spanning mattresses, furniture, and home décor, said Master Capital Services. The domestic brokerage noted that India’s home and furnishings market, which was valued at around Rs 3 trillion in 2024, is projected to grow to up to Rs 5.9 trillion by calendar year 2030, marking an 11-13 percent CAGR. This will be driven by organized retail expansion, online adoption, and premiumization. Master Capital Services said that within this category, India’s mattress market is projected to grow at a 10–12 percent CAGR by calendar year 2030, driven by rising awareness of sleep wellness and demand for branded, ergonomic products. “Investors may consider the IPO as a potential long-term investment opportunity,” it said.

The airport authority urged travellers to verify their flight status before leaving for the terminal, noting that schedules remain unstable as the airline works to restore normal operations. Passenger Advisory issued at 06:30 Hours#DelhiAirport#PassengerAdvisory#DELAdvisorypic.twitter.com/hrpGxn7Oxr — Delhi Airport (@DelhiAirport) December 8, 2025 “IndiGo flights may continue to experience delays. Passengers are advised to check the latest flight status with their airline before heading to the airport to avoid any circumstances,” the advisory said. IndiGo’s nationwide operational crisis has continued to ripple across India, with thousands of passengers still facing cancellations, delays, missing baggage and pending refunds. Over six days, the airline cancelled more than 2,000 domestic and international flights, triggering widespread chaos at major airports. The airline said it has so far processed Rs 610 crore in refunds and delivered around 3,000 pieces of delayed baggage. On Sunday, IndiGo operated about 1,650 of its scheduled 2,300 flights, while roughly 650 remained cancelled. The carrier has announced automatic refunds for cancelled bookings and waived change and cancellation fees for travel between December 5 and 15. Meanwhile, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has granted a one-time 24-hour extension to IndiGo’s Accountable Manager and CEO to reply to the show-cause notice issued on December 6 over large-scale disruptions and alleged non-compliances. The officials sought additional time citing operational constraints linked to the scale of the airline’s network and multiple factors behind the disruptions. After reviewing the request, the DGCA extended the deadline only until 6 pm on December 8 and warned that no further extensions would be granted. Failure to submit a comprehensive response, the regulator said, would result in the case being decided ex parte. The show-cause notice, issued to CEO Pieter Elbers, accused the airline of “significant lapses in planning, oversight and resource management” and a failure to adequately prepare for new Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) norms. The DGCA said this amounted to prima facie non-compliance with the Aircraft Rules, 1937, and related crew duty and rest regulations. The regulator also flagged shortcomings in passenger care, noting that IndiGo did not provide mandatory assistance to those affected by cancellations and delays, in violation of passenger rights norms. As disruptions persisted on Sunday, over 400 flights were cancelled, IndiGo said it expects to stabilise operations by December 10. CEO Pieter Elbers said the airline is “recovering from the disruption” and plans to operate around 1,650 flights as it adapts to the impact of the revised FDTL rules. Major hubs, including Hyderabad, Kolkata and Delhi, saw the highest cancellations as thousands of passengers remained stranded or awaiting refunds.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/indigo-flight-chaos-to-persist-today-warns-delhi-airport-amid-slow-operational-recovery-13714589.html

175,Business,"Metal stocks rise for 8th day as global prices soar, Hind Copper, SAIL shares jump up to 15%; what lies ahead?","December 29, 2025 / 10:50 IST","The shares of metal companies surged for the eighth consecutive session on December 29, with heavyweights like Hindustan Copper, SAIL, Tata Steel and others surging up to 15 percent. Analysts have decoded the reasons behind the recent surge in the stocks, and what lies ahead. The sharp rise in the metal stocks today pushed the Nifty Metal index up 1.5 percent to 10,967.75, as seen at 9.55 am on Monday. Earlier during the day, the index hit a fresh 52-week high of 10,983.20. The index has now gained around 5 percent in eight sessions of gains so far. Why are metal stocks rising? The sharp rise in the metal stocks has been supported by a favourable global macro setup rather than a single trigger, said Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS. ""Recent sessions saw Nifty Metal and key names like Hindustan Copper, Hindalco, Vedanta and SAIL push to fresh highs, aided by broad-based buying across ferrous and non-ferrous counters. Turnover has picked up, signalling institutional interest returning after a weak November,"" the analyst said. Fed rate cut hopes: The sharp rise in metal stocks comes on the back of rising metal prices, due to expectations of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in US in 2026, said Aditya Welekar, Senior Research Analyst - Metals, Axis Securities. ""The easing labor market in the U.S. provides the Fed with the opportunity to lower rates, which bodes well for the metals market,"" he said. China's policy support: A key driver has been China, where incremental policy support for infrastructure, power grids, renewable energy and urban redevelopment is improving demand visibility for steel, copper, aluminium and zinc, Dasani added. “While the property sector remains weak, state-led capex and industrial activity have stabilised, helping metal prices find a floor,” he said. Tight supply: Tight inventories across several base metals have further limited downside risk despite uneven global growth, said Dasani. Welekar from Axis Securities also noted that the supply side for both precious metals and base metals like copper and aluminum is constrained, while demand remains strong. ""The demand for silver and base metals is largely driven by the ongoing needs of electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy, and advancements in artificial intelligence (AI),"" he added. Softer US dollar: Another important tailwind has been the softer US dollar. ""With markets pricing in a gradual easing cycle in the US, the dollar index has eased from recent highs, supporting dollar-denominated commodities. Lower real yields have also improved the relative attractiveness of metals. On the supply side, mining disruptions, higher energy costs and stricter environmental norms have constrained fresh capacity additions, particularly in refined metals, just as demand from energy transition themes such as electric vehicles, power transmission and renewable infrastructure remains steady,"" said Dasani. Rally in commodity prices: The current rally in gold, silver, and copper reflects a tightening physical supply environment rather than just paper-market enthusiasm, said Charmi Shah, Business Head at Wealth1. ""Silver and copper have been running structural deficits for years. In silver, demand from solar, electronics, and EV supply chains has consistently outpaced mine supply, while inventories across major exchanges remain thin. Copper, central to electrification and energy transition themes, continues to face underinvestment in new mines, long gestation periods, and declining ore grades. These constraints are now becoming visible in pricing,"" she said. Gold's strength, meanwhile, is being reinforced by aggressive central bank accumulation across emerging markets, particularly as countries seek diversification away from fiat currencies and sovereign debt, Shah said, adding that China’s buying interest across gold, silver, and industrial metals has further amplified the rally, especially at a time when global supply chains remain fragile. Top metal gainers today: Hindustan Copper shares jumped around 7 percent to trade at Rs 508.05 apiece.  Earlier during the day, the stock jumped around 15 percent to hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 545.95 apiece. This comes as copper prices hit new all-time high levels. Copper hit a record high of $12,960 a ton earlier in the session on benchmark three month copper on the London Metal Exchange. Steel Authority of India (SAIL) shares followed, rising over 4 percent. Tata Steel, Vedanta and Jindal Steel & Power shares rose more than 2 percent each. Hindustan Zinc shares gained nearly 2 percent, while APL Apollo Tubes and JSW Steel shares gained more than 1 percent each. Welspun Corp and Hindalco Industries shares gained nearly 1 percent each, while National Aluminium (NALCO), NMDC and Adani Enterprises shares were trading in the green with marginal gains. What lies ahead? Looking ahead, momentum in metal stocks could sustain, though volatility cannot be ruled out, said Dasani. Global steel demand is projected to grow only modestly through 2030, but ex-China consumption and infrastructure spending in emerging markets should still underpin a gradual uptrend in volumes. In India, government capex and housing demand remain key tailwinds for steel makers, the analyst added. Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director at Vibhavangal Anukulakara said that metals are still vulnerable to changes in global demand, currency fluctuations and rate expectations. Hence the rise can go on, but there will be bouts of volatility and occasional pullbacks as markets digest macro data and look for global growth drivers, according to the analyst. For the near term, the trade looks supported as long as the dollar stays soft and the Fed leans dovish, but any abrupt US data surprise or fresh concerns around China’s exports could trigger sharp corrections, Dasani noted, adding that for investors, this is a classic cyclical rally: focus on balance-sheet strength and cost-efficient producers rather than chasing every spike.

He was in Pimpri-Chinchwad on Sunday to campaign for the January 15 elections. ""For the sake of the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation elections, the 'clock' and the 'tutari' (trumpet) have united. The parivar has come together,"" he said. Pawar urged party workers to work hard and refrain from making any controversial comments during rallies. ""We are the ones who work for development. We will edge out those who tried to put this municipal corporation in debt,"" he said. Meanwhile, talks between the two parties are underway for a tie-up for the Pune Municipal Corporation polls. Earlier in the day, the Pawar family was in Baramati, where industrialist Gautam Adani inaugurated the Sharadchandra Pawar Centre of Excellence in Artificial Intelligence. Elections to 29 municipal corporations across Maharashtra, including the Pimpri-Chinchwad and Pune civic bodies, will be held on January 15, and votes will be counted the next day. The last date for filing nominations is December 30.

179,Business,Buy Coforge; target of Rs 2500: Motilal Oswal,"December 29, 2025 / 13:24 IST","Motilal Oswal's research report on Coforge Coforge announced the acquisition of Encora, a US-based engineering and AI-led services firm with revenue of ~USD500m, adding ~26% to Coforge’s FY26E revenue base. Encora has ~9,300 employees, implying revenue per employee of ~USD74k vs. ~USD69k for Coforge, and operates at higher margins than Coforge. The vertical mix, primarily HiTech and Healthcare, is a positive, especially given Coforge’s strategic intent to scale these segments. Management has indicated that the transaction could be EPS accretive from day one. While there is limited clarity at this stage on the integration approach, past evidence is supportive: SLK Global was ~9-11% of Coforge revenue at the time of acquisition, while Cigniti was ~16%. That said, earlier acquisitions were largely client-led, whereas this transaction is more capability- and leadership-driven, making talent retention and execution discipline more critical given the larger scale of the deal. Outlook We continue to view Coforge as a structurally strong mid-tier player well-placed to benefit from vendor consolidation/cost-takeout deals and digital transformation. We value Coforge at 32x (considering a potential dilution) FY28E EPS with a TP of INR2,500, implying a 49% potential upside. Reiterate BUY.

180,Business,MC EXPLAINER      Digital gold: What you should know before investing,"December 29, 2025 / 12:11 IST","Gold was back on focus in 2025, thanks to the volatility in stock markets and rising global uncertainties. New ways to invest in gold, like digital gold, are catching on. According to a recent Moneycontrol report based on NPCI (National Payments Council of India) data, India’s digital gold market recorded year-to-date trading volumes of 940.56 million transactions, with total value exceeding Rs 12,471 crore up to November 2025. Also read: Digital gold volumes cross 940 million YTD; November value declines Digital gold makes buying and holding gold simple, but it also comes with its own set of costs, risks, and regulatory gaps. Here’s a closer look at what investors need to know. What Is digital gold? In simple terms, digital gold lets you invest in gold without physically holding coins or bars. It’s gaining popularity because it allows small starting amounts, with some platforms accepting investments as low as a Rs 10 . In the process, gold is stored in insured vaults, so investors don’t have to worry about keeping it at home, and you can buy or sell it online, without visiting a physical jewellery store. Investors can purchase digital gold through apps like Paytm, PhonePe, Google Pay, and Amazon, or through jewellers like Tanishq, Malabar Gold & Diamonds, and Kalyan Jewellers. These platforms buy physical gold on behalf of the investors and store it in secure, insured vaults. Ownership is recorded electronically, so that investors can track it, sell it, or convert it into physical gold whenever they want. Shweta Rajani, Head of Mutual Funds at Anand Rathi Wealth, explains that unlike exchange-traded products, digital gold prices are not set in an open market. She says, “During volatile market conditions, platforms may widen buy–sell spreads or adjust sell prices, which can result in less favourable exit prices for investors.” Sebi’s advisory Digital gold is not regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), unlike gold Exchange-traded Funds (ETFs) or sovereign gold bonds. This lack of regulation affects transparency and investor protection. In November 2025, Sebi cautioned the public, clarifying that digital gold products offered online fall outside the securities and commodity frameworks. The regulator noted that investors cannot rely on the protections available to regulated instruments and must depend entirely on the platform and the vault custodian. How to start and what it costs Getting started with digital gold is straightforward. After choosing a provider, such as Paytm, PhonePe, or Google Pay, download the app, register yourself, and verify your identity, using a government-issued ID. Linking your bank account or UPI helps completes the setup. There are multiple layers of costs involved. The price an investor can see in the app usually includes a platform margin and 3 percent GST (Goods and Services Tax) at purchase. For example, an investment of Rs 10,000 may include around Rs 300 in GST and another Rs 300 as an embedded spread. When selling, the platform may apply a spread (Difference between purchase and sale price) of 2–3 percent or more. Storage is often free for a limited period, but the cost is embedded in pricing. If one converts digital gold into physical coins or bars, additional making charges, delivery fees, and GST apply. Rajani notes, “The embedded spread in digital gold covers costs, such as storage, insurance, vaulting, platform fees, and the service margin charged by the provider. These are costs investors often don’t see upfront.” Taxation for digital gold mirrors that of physical gold. Short-term gains within 24 months are taxed at your income tax slab, while gains after 24 months are taxed at 12.5 percent without indexation. Platforms and providers Platforms such as Paytm, PhonePe, Google Pay, and Amazon act as the interface for buying and selling digital gold. Physical gold is sourced and verified by providers like MMTC-PAMP, SafeGold, and Augmont, and stored in insured vaults operated by partners such as Brinks India and Loomis India. Who should invest? Digital gold works well for investors who value convenience, small investment thresholds, and easy access. It can be a good way to save gradually. However, Rajani cautions, “For long-term wealth creation or significant allocations, we suggest investors avoid digital gold due to its hidden costs such as higher spreads, storage charges embedded in pricing, counterparty risk, and the absence of regulatory safeguards, comparable to market-linked instruments.” Risks and considerations Digital gold carries operational and counterparty risks. Platform issues or problems with vault partners can delay access to one’s gold, and liquidity depends on the platform, which may widen spreads during volatility. Implicit costs and limited transparency make it difficult to know exact returns. Most platforms allow conversion into physical coins or bars, but this comes with extra charges, delivery timelines, and minimum quantity rules, making it less convenient than keeping it digitally or investing through ETFs. Digital gold vs other gold investments Digital gold is extremely convenient but lacks the regulation, transparent pricing, and liquidity of ETFs or mutual funds. On the other hand, Gold ETFs are Sebi-regulated, exchange-traded, and priced through open markets, providing clear costs and liquidity. There are around 27 gold funds currently (gold MFs and ETFs), including Nippon India Gold Bees, SBI Gold ETF, HDFC Gold ETF, Tata Gold ETF FoF, Quantum Gold Savings Fund, and Axis Gold Fund. Short-term gains are taxed at your slab rate if held up to 12 months for ETFs or up to 24 months for mutual funds/FoFs, while long-term gains are taxed at 12.5 percent without indexation.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/digital-gold-what-you-should-know-before-investing-13746243.html
181,Business,Missed a personal loan EMI? What to do next,"December 29, 2025 / 13:16 IST","Defaulting on a personal loan EMI often feels like a personal failure. In reality, it’s a cash-flow problem, and it happens far more often than people admit. Medical bills, delayed payments, job loss, business slowdowns—life interferes. What matters is not the missed EMI itself, but how you respond in the days that follow. Here’s how to think clearly and act quickly when you’ve just defaulted. First, understand what has actually happened Missing one EMI does not automatically make you a “defaulter” in the legal sense. Banks and NBFCs typically classify accounts in stages. A single missed EMI puts your loan into early delinquency. It becomes a non-performing asset only after prolonged non-payment. That distinction matters, because your options are far wider early on. However, credit bureaus are unforgiving. Even one missed EMI can show up on your credit report and hurt your score. The impact is sharper for unsecured loans like personal loans. This is why speed matters. Second, check whether this is a timing issue or a real shortfall Before calling the lender, be honest with yourself. Did you miss the EMI because of a temporary delay in cash flow, or because your finances can no longer support the EMI amount? If money is coming in within days, your goal is to regularise the account as fast as possible. If the problem is structural—job loss, income drop, medical expenses—you need a different conversation with the lender. This self-assessment helps you avoid false promises that you can’t keep. Third, contact the lender before they chase you Many borrowers wait until recovery calls start. That’s a mistake. Lenders are far more cooperative when you approach them first. Call customer service or your relationship manager and clearly state that you’ve missed an EMI and want to regularise or discuss options. Keep the tone factual, not emotional. You’re signalling intent to pay, which matters a lot in internal risk systems. If you can pay the EMI within a few days, ask about late payment charges and the fastest way to close the overdue amount. The sooner the loan is brought current, the less damage to your credit profile. Fourth, do not ignore calls, even if they feel intimidating Once an EMI is missed, calls and messages will come. Ignoring them does not buy you time; it escalates the account internally. Even if you don’t have a solution yet, answering calls and acknowledging the issue reduces the chances of aggressive follow-ups. If recovery agents cross the line, remember that lenders are bound by RBI fair-practice norms. You can ask for communication during reasonable hours and insist on respectful conduct. But disengaging completely usually backfires. Fifth, explore short-term relief if cash flow is genuinely tight If you cannot immediately pay, ask the lender what temporary relief options exist. These may include a short grace period, restructuring of EMIs, or converting unpaid interest into future instalments. Not all lenders offer all options, but asking early keeps doors open. Be careful about taking a fresh loan or using credit cards to pay EMIs. This often creates a debt spiral that looks manageable for a month or two and then collapses. A delayed payment with a plan is usually better than juggling high-cost credit in silence. Sixth, protect your other EMIs and essentials Once one EMI is missed, borrowers often start missing others because everything feels broken. That’s dangerous. Prioritise essentials and secured loans like home loans or vehicle loans, where default consequences are more severe. A single missed personal loan EMI is recoverable. Multiple missed payments across products can quickly snowball into a broader credit crisis. Seventh, watch your credit report, but don’t obsess over it Your credit score may dip. That’s unpleasant, but it’s not permanent. Scores recover over time with regular payments. What causes lasting damage is repeated delinquencies, settlements, or write-offs. Once the overdue is cleared, focus on consistency. Even six to nine months of clean repayment can stabilise your profile significantly. A realistic closing thought Defaulting on an EMI feels dramatic in the moment, but financially it’s a small window, not a cliff edge. The system is harsher on silence than on struggle. If you engage early, explain clearly, and avoid compounding the problem with bad stop-gap borrowing, most single-EMI defaults remain just that—a temporary stumble, not a long-term scar.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/missed-a-personal-loan-emi-what-to-do-next-13746523.html
182,Business,Coforge shares rise even as analysts say $2.35-bn deal to buy Encora 'bold' but earnings dilutive,"December 29, 2025 / 10:23 IST","The shares of Coforge rose more than 2 percent in the morning trading hours of December 29 after the IT firm said that it will acquire US-based engineering services company Encora in a $2.35-billion all-stock transaction. The shares of the IT firm rose to Rs 1,711 apiece in the early trading hours of Monday, snapping a three-session losing streak. This comes even as brokerages remain divergent about their views on the impact of the acquisition of the AI firm. Coforge to acquire US-based AI firm Encora: In an exchange filing released in the post market hours of December 26, Coforge said that the acquisition will be executed through a share swap, under which the company will issue 93.8 million equity shares at Rs 1,815.91 apiece, implying a non-cash consideration of about Rs 17,032 crore. Encora shareholders will hold about 21.25 percent of Coforge’s post-issue equity capital. ""Coforge's acquisition of Encora will create a $2.5 billion Tech Services powerhouse with both the scale and capability across AI-led engineering, Cloud, and Data services to drive enterprise-grade AI-solutions,"" a release by the company read after it concluded its board meeting. Earlier, Moneycontrol exclusively reported that Coforge is in advanced discussions to acquire Encora, potentially marking one of the largest transactions in the digital engineering space, citing sources. Here's what brokerages say: Macquarie remained bullish on the shares of the company, double-upgrading its rating to 'Outperform' from 'Underperform' and raising its target price to Rs 2,230 apiece. This implies an upside potential of over 33 percent from the stock's previous closing price. The international brokerage believes that the acquisition of Encora will improve Coforge's service portfolio, and view this deal as a positive in the long term as it can accelerate Coforge's revenue growth, according to CNBC-TV18. Macquarie now expects longer-term sustainable revenue growth to be 15-18 percent. Elara Capital downgraded Coforge shares to ‘Reduce’ from ‘Accumulate’, and lowered its target price for the stock to Rs 1,720 per share from Rs 2,120 per share. The latest target price implies an upside potential of nearly 3 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The domestic brokerage noted that the acquisition will possibly help Coforge address its gaps in the North American market. However, valuations at EV/sales of 3.9x appear expensive considering that Encora posted only 7-10 percent organic revenue growth in the past two years, lower than Coforge’s revenue growth, it added. “Historically (in FY21-25), Coforge had reported high teen revenue CAGR on account of stable management, strong order book and specialization in select verticals of BFS, Insurance and Travel. Encora’s organic revenue growth, on the other ha nd, was lower at 7-10%. Despite lower growth, COFORGE is acquiring Encora at 3.9X EV/sales and ~21x EV/EBITDA, in line with COFORGE ’s multiples, which appears expensive. So, we cut our target multiple for COFORGE from 39x to 34x to reflect higher valuation concern. Organically also, some costs for COFORGE witnessed an uptick in recent quarters, which may strain its margins, going ahead. Thus, we cut our earnings estimates by 7–8% for FY27E and FY28E, respectively,” it said. Motilal Oswal Financial Services noted that the scale of transaction is large, therefore execution remains critical. Integration, leadership retention, margin management post-integration, and amortization will be the key monitorables. It however said that the vertical mix, primarily hi-tech and healthcare, is a positive, especially given Coforge’s strategic intent to scale these segments. “We believe Coforge’s strong executable order book and resilient client spending across verticals bode well for its organic business. This acquisition expands Coforge’s presence in the Hi-Tech and Healthcare verticals, though we have not yet incorporated Encora's numbers into our valuation. We continue to view Coforge as a structurally strong mid-tier player well-placed to benefit from vendor consolidation/cost-takeout deals and digital transformation,” the domestic brokerage said, while reiterating its ‘Buy’ call on the stock and a target price of Rs 2,500 per share, implying an upside potential of 49 percent. JM Financial said that the valuation looks rich given Encora’s 7 – 10 percent growth profile, CNBC-TV18 reported. Morgan Stanley analysts called the deal a ""bold move"", but said that the price tag appears expensive and is likely to be dilutive to earnings. Coforge's preference share issue creates an overhang once the lock-in period ends, Morgan Stanley added, forecasting a 12–13 percent decline in the stock. DAM Capital analysts said deal to be EPS dilutive, especially since price paid is higher than the firm's current valuation.

186,Business,OPINION | Indian equity markets in a volatile 2025 displayed resilience,"December 29, 2025 / 13:32 IST","2025 was a testament to the enduring resilience of Indian equity markets. Despite encountering periods of heightened volatility and a measured start after the remarkable gains of 2024, our markets demonstrated their ability to adapt and recover. Global headwinds—including evolving US trade policies and ongoing geopolitical tensions—introduced intermittent uncertainty, yet their impact was effectively managed and contained. Renewed momentum in the second half What stands out most is the renewed momentum we witnessed in the latter part of the year. This resurgence propelled both the Sensex and Nifty towards new lifetime highs, reaffirming the robust fundamentals and long-term potential of the India growth story. As we look ahead, I remain confident that our market’s underlying strength and adaptability will continue to drive sustainable value for all stakeholders. Economic developments of 2025 that helped # Robust Growth Momentum: India’s economy continues to outperform expectations, with real GDP growth reaching 7.8% and 8.2% year-on-year in Q1 and Q2 FY26, respectively. # Supportive Monetary Policy: The RBI’s proactive stance—easing liquidity and cutting the repo rate by 125 basis points—has started to stimulate credit growth. With inflation remaining benign, there is potential for further rate reductions. # Tax and Regulatory Reforms: The government’s move to simplify GST rates from five to three slabs marks a significant reform. Lower GST rates across various products and services, along with reduced income tax rates in the Union Budget 2025, are expected to boost disposable incomes, especially for the middle class, with positive effects likely to be seen in the latter half of the fiscal year and beyond. # Rural Demand Strengthening: A favourable monsoon and low inflation have lifted rural consumer confidence, setting the stage for stronger demand in the coming quarters. A snapshot of market performance Stability in Large Caps, Pressure in Small Caps: Market performance in 2025 showed a clear divergence across segments. While key benchmark indices like the Nifty 50 TRI (+11%) and BSE Sensex TRI (+10%) delivered steady returns (January 1 to December 15), and the broader BSE 200 TRI gained nearly 9%, mid-cap stocks saw moderate growth (+5% on the Nifty Midcap 150 TRI). In contrast, small-cap stocks corrected sharply, with the BSE Small Cap TRI falling by about 7%. Despite headline indices trading near all-time highs, market breadth was weak—only 14% of Nifty 500 stocks were close to their 52-week highs, and over half were down 20% or more from their peaks. This indicates that index gains were driven by a narrow group of stocks, underscoring the importance of selective, fundamentally driven investment strategies (Bloomberg. Data period Jan 1 to Dec 22, 2025 closing period has been considered.) Sectoral Trends: Metals shine, Realty cracks 2025 has seen significant divergence in sectoral performance. The BSE Metal index delivered strong returns of over 23%, while the BSE Auto TRI gained around 20%, supported by demand recovery and improved operating efficiencies. Banking and financial services also performed well, posting gains of about 16%, driven by healthy balance sheets and steady credit growth. However, some sectors faced challenges during the year. Information Technology sector declined by around 12%. Consumer Durables and Real Estate also ended the year in negative territory, with real estate declining by over 16 (Data period Jan 1 to Dec 15, 2025). FIIs and DIIs – DIIs shine as Indian savings steps in In 2025, the Indian market saw a clear divide between foreign and domestic investors. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) withdrew funds in 7 out of 11 months, resulting in net outflows of Rs 1,43,675 crore. In contrast, Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs), especially mutual funds, consistently injected capital every month, with net inflows totaling Rs 6,85,421 crore (AMFI Data as on Jan 1 to Nov 28, 2025). This resilience was largely supported by disciplined retail investors through systematic investment plans (SIPs), which played a key role in maintaining market stability during volatile periods Mutual fund asset base grows - Hybrid mutual funds lead the rise The mutual fund industry demonstrated robust growth across all major categories, underpinned by strong retail investor participation and consistent inflows, especially through SIPs. Strong Growth in AUM: The domestic mutual fund industry’s assets under management (AUM) surged by 20.25%, rising from Rs 66.99 lakh crore in January to approximately Rs 80.55 lakh crore in November 2025.Retail Investor Confidence: Retail participation remains a key driver, supported by increased digital adoption, affordable SIPs, and greater financial awareness.Hybrid Funds: Assets in hybrid funds grew by 24.28% to Rs 10.88 lakh crore, with a net inflow of Rs 145,886 crore, mainly due to gains in dynamic asset allocation/balanced advantage funds.Open-ended Equity Funds: These funds saw a 21.01% rise in assets to Rs 35.65 lakh crore, with net inflows of Rs 322,098 crore.Open-ended Debt Funds: Assets increased by 13.43% to Rs 19.35 lakh crore, with net inflows of Rs 229,221 crore.SIP Collections: Systematic investment plan (SIP) collections continued their upward trend, reaching Rs 303,978 crore by November 2025 (AMFI Data as on Jan 1 to Nov 28, 2025). Gold and silver deliver superb returns Gold and silver broke records in 2025. Silver reached record levels in 2025 posting outstanding returns, its best returns in decades led by strong industrial demands. Gold prices also climbed strongly in 2025 gaining around 70% due to safe haven demand amid rising global uncertainty. Road ahead India’s growth trajectory remains robust and forward-looking. The domestic macroeconomic environment continues to provide a solid foundation, underpinned by moderating inflation, the prospect of monetary easing, strong government-led capital expenditure, ample liquidity, and ongoing structural reforms. While near-term global uncertainties may result in range-bound markets, India’s investment cycle is well-positioned for further acceleration over the medium term, fueled by significant advancements in infrastructure, manufacturing, renewable energy, and supply-chain localisation. We maintain a constructive outlook on equities over the long term, viewing periods of market volatility as strategic opportunities to build high-quality portfolios. On the fixed income side, favourable inflation dynamics and a well-managed current account deficit create a supportive backdrop, further reinforced by stable price levels and improving external balances. Looking ahead to 2026, we believe that a well-diversified allocation across equities, fixed income, and commodities will be instrumental in navigating market volatility and capturing opportunities amid an evolving geopolitical landscape.

But beyond the headline number, the bigger story is that the IPO boom is no longer cyclical — it is becoming structural, according to Pantomath Capital’s Primary Pulse 2025 report. The study finds that India now leads the world in IPO volumes and has firmly transitioned from opportunistic listing waves to steady, broad-based capital mobilisation. Mainboard IPOs crossed the 100-deal mark in 2025 — the first time since 2007 — supported by a healthy mix of offerings across sizes, particularly in the Rs100–500 crore and Rs1,000–2,000 crore bands. Unlike markets dominated by a few blockbuster issues, India’s pipeline reflects continuity and depth. Crucially, the quality of capital deployment is improving. More than three-quarters of IPO proceeds are being channelled toward expansion, capacity creation, working capital and debt reduction — signalling productive investment rather than financial restructuring. Fund mobilisation has been led by financial services, followed by manufacturing, industrials and consumption-linked sectors, aligning closely with India’s long-term growth themes, the report said. The report also added that the investor participation is widening alongside. While Mumbai remains the anchor, strong demand is emerging from Gujarat hubs such as Ahmedabad, Surat and Rajkot — and increasingly from non-metro centres like Bhilai, Kendrapara and Hisar, highlighting the democratisation of equity investing, it said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ipo/rs4-lakh-crore-ipo-wave-ahead-in-2026-says-pantomath-13746637.html

Silver prices decline: After hitting an all-time high of Rs 2,54,174 per kg, silver futures with March expiry on MCX fell more than 8 percent to Rs 2,33,120 per kg. The futures contracts with May and July expiries also erased all gains, falling 9 percent and 10 percent respectively after hitting fresh lifetime highs during the day. This comes after the precious and industrial metal saw a record bull run. ""A combination of profit-taking and seemingly productive talks between Trump and Zelensky regarding a potential peace deal have put gold, silver on the back foot,"" said KCM Trade Chief Market Analyst Tim Waterer, as quoted by Reuters. ""Rate cuts and a continuation of robust industrial appetite paired with supply shortages could have silver primed for a run towards $100 in 2026,"" Waterer added. The recent surge in Hindustan Zinc shares was mostly driven by the sharp rise in silver prices. Hindustan Zinc is the largest producer of silver in India, and produces refined silver with a minimum 99.9 percent purity. Hence, the intraday fall in silver prices may have impacted Hindustan Zinc’s share price. Hindustan Zinc share price: Despite today's fall, Hindustan Zinc shares have gained nearly 4 percent in the past five days, and around 26 percent in the past one month. The stock is up around 42 percent in 2025 so far. It has a P/E ratio of 26, and a market cap of more than Rs 2.66 lakh crore.

194,Business,"Bank Nifty falls below 59,000 as IndusInd, ICICI, HDFC Bank shares fall up to 1.5%: Check key levels to watch out for","December 29, 2025 / 13:14 IST","Bank stocks declined on December 29, led by losses in heavyweights including IndusInd Bank, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank. The Nifty Bank index has now declined for the fourth consecutive session. The Nifty Bank index fell 0.32 percent to 58,823.40, as seen at 12.25 pm on Monday. Check key technical levels to watch out for some upside chances or more downside. Technical view on Bank Nifty: Nifty Bank index continued to find it difficult to gain upside traction, facing persistent supply at higher levels and swift profit-booking on even minor intraday recoveries, said SAMCO Securities. ""The overall tone remained cautious and restrained, with the index largely moving within its established trading corridor,"" it said. “From a technical standpoint, the index remains entrenched in a consolidation phase, with the broader range capped near 59,600 on the upside and supported around 58,600 on the downside. The continuation of a lower-high formation keeps 59,500 firmly positioned as a critical pivot for any meaningful trend reversal,” it added. Angel One remained bullish on the index, stating that 59,500 -59,800 remain the key resistance levels to watch for. On the downside, the domestic brokerage sees the index finding support at 58,800 -58,500 levels. The Bank Nifty is consolidating after its recent rally and is respecting key support levels, said Choice Broking. “Immediate support is seen at 58,700–58,800, while resistance is placed at 59,300–59,400. A decisive close above resistance could push the index toward 59,800–60,000, whereas a breakdown may extend consolidation,” it added. According to Ventura's daily updates report, Bank Nifty will find its first support at 58,912, followed by 58,813 and 58,679. On the upper side, the brokerage said that the index will find resistance at 59,145, 59,279 and 59,378. “If the trend is strong Bank Nifty will not breach (58080-57230) area. If these levels are breached one should wait for 56553-(55933-55345). Above 59478 we open for (59713 -60114- 61050—62540—63470) levels. Our view is after minor correction we have a high probability for Bank Nifty to cross 60114 and reach 61050—62540—63470 area,” Ventura said. Top losers on the Nifty Bank index today: IndusInd Bank shares were the top loser on the index, falling 1.5 percent o trade at Rs 836.80 apiece. AU Small Finance Bank shares followed, falling nearly 1 percent. ICICI Bank, IDFC First Bank and HDFC Bank shares fell around 0.5 percent each, while Kotak Mahindra Bank, State Bank of India (SBI), Federal Bank and Axis Bank shares were trading in the red with marginal losses.

196,Business,To be or not to be a bank: That's a question for Sanjiv Bajaj & RBI,"December 29, 2025 / 12:32 IST","Bajaj Finance had a loan book of Rs 4.62 lakh crore, growing at 24% y-o-y at the end of the September 30. In contrast Kotak Bank reported deposits of 5.3 lakh crore in September, and growing at 15% y-o-y. This means if Bajaj Finance were a bank today, will be the fifth largest private sector bank and may in a couple of years become the fourth largest if both Bajaj and Kotak maintain the same pace of growth as this year. And by 2030 Bajaj Finance AUM will have grown to over Rs 10 lakh crore if it keeps to its guided growth pace of 20-22% per annum. The question before Bajaj Finserv and RBI is whether Bajaj Finance needs to become a bank. ""Will you be able to borrow wholesale on such a scale for such a size of lending? Don't you think you have to become a bank?,"" I asked Bajaj Finserv’s Chairman & MD Sanjiv Bajaj while interviewing him for our series 'Latha & The Leaders'. ""Not really,"" replied Sanjiv. ""First, as per the laws of the country, we can't be a bank because business houses are not allowed to be a bank."" Further Sanjiv argued that the NBFC multi-tier model created by RBI defining Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Housing are upper layer, ensures adequate compliance. It enables NBFCs to borrow from debt markets, banks and via fixed deposits or debentures from retail investors. ""I think if we continue doing that into the next decade, it should take us to the kind of numbers that you're saying,"" said Sanjiv. But banks of his size have savings deposits coming at 3.5%, I persisted. Won't Bajaj Finance feel the pinch if doesn’t become a bank very soon? I asked. ""Firstly, banks' average cost of borrowing is not 3.5%,"", shot back Sanjiv. ""Second, we compete in the consumer lending space, in the SME lending space, in the corporate lending space with the best of banks. If it was so obvious, we would not be doing and others would not be doing as well as they are. So everything is not just linked to a deposit,"" he argued. ""One of my few asks from RBI is,"" continued Sanjiv ""like RBI provides a liquidity backstop to banks, you know, their lender of last resort. And for that, banks provide some security. My ask from RBI is they should offer this to the upper layer NBFCs too … Also, a few other areas around payments. If they equalize the norms over there, while protecting the small depositor and stuff with the banking license, I think you're creating a very viable financial services credit opportunity that India needs,"" said Sanjiv. The RBI has historically been opposed to providing liquidity facility to NBFCs, Mutual Funds and other entities in the money market. Banks are provided liquidity backstop facilities because they take deposits from the lowest common denominator of savers, whom the RBI wants to protect. Banks also perform semi fiscal roles like lending mandatorily to the priority sector and providing basic banking facilities free of cost. From the RBI’s angle, the preference is that large NBFCs convert themselves into a bank so that they are more rigorously regulated and yet RBI is averse to giving bank licences to conglomerates due to the obvious problem of connected lending. Sanjiv Bajaj wouldn’t buy that argument. Firstly what is a business house is a definition that's up for grabs, he said. Probably alluding to the fact that Bajaj Finserv has no crossholding with Bajaj Auto. Indeed Bajaj Auto has now set up its own finance company to lend to buyers of Bajaj 2-wheelers, since they find that Bajaj Finance doesn’t give their customers any preferential treatment. Secondly, Sanjiv argued that even if NBFCs don’t directly take deposits, they borrow from banks, so instability in the NBFC sector can hurt bank depositors ultimately. “Third is, to your own point on interconnected lending, ... today, I know what kind of monthly data dumps goes from us as an upper layer NBFC to the regulators. With AI, there is no reason why you cannot unearth Interconnected lending,” he told me. To be fair, not just Sanjiv, a bunch of top corporate groups are keen on a banking licence. The fact that two large Japanese financial groups have picked up large stakes in a prominent Indian bank and NBFC, adds to their angst. If India needs to grow at 8-9% and become Viksit Bharat by 2047, who but Indian businesses will bring the capital, goes the argument. Every RBI governor is confronted with this demand from business houses including the present governor Sanjay Malhotra and all his predecessors shied away from the idea for fear of interconnected lending. But Sanjiv Bajaj is bringing forth a fresh argument: that unlike in the past, with the coming of artificial intelligence, RBI may be able to unearth connected lending easily. This argument is certainly worth debating. For if RBI’s supervision can be made so fool proof, then the country can have its cake and eat it too i.e. it can harness the capital of large business groups for banking capital and RBI can still save the economy from nepotistic lending, It will be interesting to see how this A.I. argument evolves. For now, Sanjiv Bajaj is confident he can grow Bajaj Finance at the same furious pace that he has done in the past two decades, even without a banking licence.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/to-be-or-not-to-be-a-bank-that-s-a-question-for-sanjiv-bajaj-rbi-13746451.html

198,Business,PSU Bank stocks fall for 4th day: What should investors do in 2026?,"December 29, 2025 / 11:40 IST","The shares of public sector banks (PSB) dropped in trade on December 29, extending losses for the fourth consecutive session. Analysts have advised what investors should do in the near-term. The fall in the share prices pushed the Nifty PSU Bank index down 0.3 percent to 8,263.55, as seen at 11.20 am on Monday. What lies ahead? For the immediate future, the shares of PSU banks are likely to remain volatile, said Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director at Vibhavangal Anukulakara. Although the asset quality ratios, capital adequacy, and balance sheet strength of the banks have shown improvement, the valuations have started undergoing consolidation, coming after the recent rally, he added. ""The coming times would be stock-specific, with earnings performance and policy cues playing important roles in determining the course,"" the analyst said. Pravesh Gour, Senior Technical Analyst at Swastika Investmart, said that the outperformance seen in PSU Bank stocks recently before the consolidation should be taken by investors both as an opportunity and something that warrants caution. ""PSU bank stocks have emerged as clear leaders in 2025, driven by a rare alignment of strong fundamentals, improving asset quality, and supportive macro conditions. After years of balance sheet stress, most public sector banks have cleaned up their books, with gross and net NPAs falling to multi-year lows. This has reduced credit costs and lifted profitability, allowing PSU banks to report steady growth in return on assets and return on equity. At the same time, robust credit demand from infrastructure, manufacturing, MSMEs, and retail borrowers has supported healthy loan growth, while better capital adequacy has given these banks room to expand without frequent dilution,"" Gour said. He added that valuation re-rating is another key reason behind PSU banks’ dominance. “For a long period, PSU banks traded at deep discounts to private sector peers due to governance concerns and weak earnings visibility. In 2025, as earnings have stabilized and visibility improved, investors have begun to reprice these stocks upward, narrowing the valuation gap. Government support, ongoing reforms, and improved operational efficiency through digitization have further strengthened confidence. In addition, PSU banks tend to benefit directly from higher public capex and policy-led credit growth, making them natural beneficiaries of India’s infrastructure-led growth push,” he said. On the positive side, the structural turnaround suggests that select PSU banks can deliver steady compounding over the long run, supported by improving profitability, stable asset quality, and reasonable valuations compared with private banks, he said. However, investors should be mindful that a significant part of the re-rating has already played out, and returns may normalize from here, the analyst noted. ""Stock selection becomes critical, with a focus on banks that demonstrate consistent earnings growth, strong capital buffers, and disciplined lending. Overall, PSU banks in 2025 reflect a sector in recovery and transition, offering long-term investors a blend of value and growth, provided expectations remain realistic and investment decisions are selective,"" Gour concluded. Top PSU Bank losers today: Central Bank of India shares were the top loser on the Nifty PSU Bank index, falling more than 1 percent to trade at Rs 36.47 apiece. Union Bank of India, Punjab National Bank (PNB), Punjab & Sind Bank (PSB), Bank of India and UCO Bank shares fell around 1 percent each.

203,Business,"IHCL’s low borrowings obscure a much larger lease liability footprint, quick execution is key, say analysts","December 29, 2025 / 13:11 IST","The Indian Hotels Company Ltd (IHCL), the owner of the Taj group of hotels and its associated brands, has reported consolidated borrowings of Rs 279 crore as of September 30, according to its latest investor presentation, even as its lease liabilities stood at Rs 2,947 crore during the same period. The Tata group-owned hospitality company has been highlighting its transition towards a capital-light growth strategy, with a greater focus on operating hotels through management contracts rather than owning or leasing properties. However, the latest disclosures show that lease liabilities continue to form a significant part of the company’s balance sheet. As of the end of the September quarter, IHCL’s lease liabilities were more than ten times its consolidated borrowings. The figure was marginally higher than the Rs 2,860 crore reported at the end of FY25, indicating that overall lease commitments have remained broadly stable despite the company’s stated intent to reduce exposure to owned and leased assets. Lease liabilities differ from conventional debt in key ways. While debt represents money borrowed from banks or lenders and brings cash into the business upfront, lease liabilities reflect future rental payments the company is contractually obligated to make for properties it uses but does not own. These obligations arise from long-term lease agreements and are recognised on the balance sheet under current accounting standards, even though they do not involve a cash inflow at inception. Unlike loans,  which can sometimes be refinanced or prepaid, lease liabilities are typically tied to long-duration contracts and are harder to renegotiate or exit without penalties. While markets generally view lease liabilities as less risky than traditional debt, they still represent fixed commitments that need to be met over time. According to IHCL’s FY25 annual report, the bulk of its lease liabilities are classified as non-current, reflecting long-dated obligations linked to hotel properties leased over several years. The scale of these obligations is also evident when compared with the company’s cash position. IHCL reported cash and cash equivalents of Rs 2,847 crore as of September 30, lower than the Rs 3,073 crore reported at the end of March, reflecting ongoing expansion activity and capital expenditure. IHCL has outlined an asset-light expansion pipeline of around 22,000 rooms, of which nearly 18,000 are expected to come from management contracts. The company has also entered into sales and distribution tie-ups with third-party hotel owners, including an agreement with the Clarks group, which operates 35 hotels across India. Despite the pivot towards management contracts, IHCL continues to invest selectively in owned assets. One such project is the upcoming Taj Bandstand hotel in Mumbai, for which the company recently completed a ₹101-crore rights issue. During April–September 2025, IHCL reported consolidated management fee income of Rs 259 crore, up 21 percent year-on-year. Management fees accounted for less than 10 percent of hotel segment revenue of Rs 3,653 crore for the period, according to company disclosures. Analysts tracking the company say execution will be critical in managing lease-related obligations going forward. The lease liability numbers are elevated at this stage, but much will depend on how quickly IHCL can scale up operations at leased properties to service these commitments. Execution will be key, said a senior analyst at a leading research firm who requested anonymity. According to another market observer, a large part of IHCL's leased properties are in the budget-to-mid-premium brands such as Ginger, leased over long tenures. Other analysts, such as from Motilal Oswal Financial Services, also remain largely upbeat on IHCL, noting that it beat peers in terms of revenue growth, at 21 percent, in the first half of the ongoing financial year. It also observed that IHCL is one of the key beneficiaries of travel and tourism growth in India, , as well as the opening of the new airport at Navi Mumbai, with the company being a large supplier of a currently-limited number of keys (around 1,500) in that market. Brokerage firm Elara Capital has noted that IHCL’s recent hotel sign-ups are increasingly skewed towards the premium Taj brand, which typically generates higher fees per room compared with mid-scale and budget formats. An email sent to IHCL seeking comment on its lease liabilities and its asset-light growth plans remained unanswered until the time of publishing this article.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ihcl-s-low-borrowings-obscure-a-much-larger-lease-liability-footprint-quick-execution-is-key-say-analysts-13746448.html
204,Business,Hold Apar Industries; target of Rs 9744: Prabhudas Lilladher,"December 29, 2025 / 12:01 IST","Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Apar Industries We interacted with the management of Apar Industries (APR) to assess the domestic demand environment, the implications of US reciprocal tariffs, and the company’s overall business outlook. The management reiterated guidance of ~Rs30,000 EBITDA/mt and ~10% volume growth in conductors, alongside ~8% YoY growth in specialty oils in FY26. The impact of reciprocal tariffs is expected to be limited to order finalization timelines. The tariffs are unlikely to have a material financial impact. Domestically, demand continues to be driven by power T&D, renewables and railways, while exports are supported by the US, Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The cables business remains a key growth engine, with the management targeting ~Rs100bn in revenue, underpinned by capacity expansion and rising demand for specialty, power and low-duty cables. Q3FY26 is expected to remain muted due to elevated raw material prices and slower order finalizations, followed by a recovery in Q4FY26. The stock is trading at a P/E of 28.4x/24.8x on FY27/28E earnings. Outlook We maintain our ‘HOLD’ rating valuing the conductors/cables/specialty oils segment at a PE of 34x/34x/12x Sep’27E (same as earlier) arriving at SoTP-derived TP of Rs9,744 (same as earlier).

205,Business,"Record agri output in 2025 amid GST cuts, US tariffs; seed, pesticide bills eyed for 2026","December 29, 2025 / 10:56 IST","India's agriculture sector closed 2025 with a projection of record foodgrain output surpassing last year's 357.73 million tonnes (MT) despite US tariffs disrupting farm exports, while landmark GST reforms delivered input cost relief, and stakeholders await passage of key seed and pesticide bills in 2026 to tackle fake inputs. The year showed both resilience and fragility -- GST rate reductions delivered noticeable cost savings, while American tariff wall compelled market diversification, officials said. ""We are hopeful of achieving record foodgrain production this year 2025-26 (July-June). Kharif output remained positive and rabi sowing is progressing well,"" Agriculture Secretary Devesh Chaturvedi told PTI. Above-normal southwest monsoons boosted kharif sowing, with the agriculture ministry's first advance estimate projected kharif foodgrain output at a record 173.33 MT for 2025-26, up from 169.4 MT in 2024-25. Rice production is predicted to exceed 124.5 MT, with maize at 28.3 MT. However, excessive September rains wreaked havoc on crops in the western and eastern regions. Rabi sowing as of December 19 reached 659.39 lakh hectares -- up 8 lakh hectares year-on-year. Wheat covered 301.63 lakh hectares (from 300.34 lakh hectares) while pulses expanded to 126.74 lakh hectares (from 123.02 lakh hectares). Despite production advances, government think-tank NITI Aayog member Ramesh Chand estimated agriculture and allied sector growth of 4 per cent for the 2025-26 fiscal year, down from 4.6 per cent before, citing base effects. Amid disconnect between record production and farmers' income, the year saw persistent protests by Samyukta Kisan Morcha (Non-Political) and Kisan Mazdoor Morcha in February at Punjab-Haryana borders, with demands for legal minimum support price guarantees based on Swaminathan formula, loan waivers, and pensions. Police cleared the camps in March, ending farmer leader Jagjit Singh Dallewal's 123-day hunger strike. Farmer unions later held rallies against the India-UK FTA and draft seed bills. US tariffs hit farm exports The 56th GST Council's decision to cut rates on farm inputs from 18 per cent to 5 per cent, effective September 22, emerged as 2025's most significant policy intervention. The reforms included tractors under 1800cc, harvesters, irrigation systems, tractor parts and tyres, alongside 12 specified bio-pesticides, micronutrients, and fertiliser raw materials. Additionally, the council exempted UHT milk, paneer, chhena, and Indian breads at zero per cent, reducing input costs by 7-13 per cent and enabling farmers to save Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh on tractor purchases. Chemical pesticides and fungicides, however, remained at 18 per cent GST. ""2025 has been a positive year for the farm equipment industry... The GST relief has supported demand by improving farmers' purchasing power and making mechanised solutions more affordable,"" CNH India President and Managing Director Narinder Mittal said. US reciprocal tariffs impacted India's USD 5-6 billion annual agri exports to the US, officials said. APEDA Secretary Sudhanshu noted impacts on shrimp, processed foods, spices, rice, guar gum, cashews, and dairy, causing lost access, slim margins, cancellations, and job risks. The sector, however, demonstrated resilience through market diversification and relative competitiveness against higher-tariffed competitors like Vietnam. Relief arrived in November through exemptions for over 200 food categories, including tea, coffee, spices, and cocoa. Overall agricultural export growth in April-September 2025 recorded 9 per cent year-on-year growth, driven by non-US markets, Sudhanshu said. Policy thrust continues With an enhanced budget of Rs 1.37 lakh crore for the 2025-26 fiscal year, the agriculture ministry focused on policies to raise farm incomes via higher productivity, lower costs, crop diversification, value addition, and direct aid. The government's first Cabinet decision on January 1 extended PM Fasal Bima Yojana and Weather-Based Crop Insurance to 2025-26 (Rs 69,516 crore outlay) and raised DAP fertiliser subsidy by Rs 3,500/tonne -- maintaining a three-year tradition of farm-focused first cabinet decisions. Major launches included the Pradhan Mantri Dhan-Dhaanya Krishi Yojana (over Rs 35,000 crore targeting 100 low-productivity districts and 1.7 crore farmers), Rs 11,440-crore National Pulses Mission, MSP hikes for rabi crops, and continuation of the Modified Interest Subvention Scheme. Under PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, over Rs 3.75 lakh crore was disbursed cumulatively, with the 21st instalment in November supporting 9 crore farmers. The electronic National Agriculture Market 2.0 was piloted in select mandis in Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu with automated bidding and logistics features, but technical issues await mid-January fixes. Regulatory tightening To strengthen oversight on substandard crop inputs amid rising farmer complaints, the government amended Schedule VI of the Fertiliser Control Order (FCO), 1985, to regulate biostimulants. Agriculture Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan pledged tougher penalties in the upcoming Parliament session, including criminal prosecution and licence cancellations, for fake fertilisers and pesticides. Fertiliser Secretary Rajat Kumar Mishra said there is robust availability of key soil nutrients through domestic production and imports from Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Morocco. Still, China's renewed export restrictions on speciality fertilisers pose risks for 2026, as per industry experts. Challenges and road ahead As 2025 ends, agriculture faces persistent challenges, including fragmented landholdings, climate change risks, 35-40 per cent post-harvest losses for perishables, and tenant farmers' exclusion from schemes. For 2026, farmers await the government's first Cabinet decision for policy support aimed at reducing production costs and boosting farm incomes. Immediate focus remains on passage of the Draft Seeds Bill, 2025, and Pesticide Management Bill, 2020 in the next Parliament session.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/record-agri-output-in-2025-amid-gst-cuts-us-tariffs-seed-pesticide-bills-eyed-for-2026-13746255.html
206,Business,Vikran Engineering shares extend rise to 3rd straight day as firm wins large orders in Solar EPC space,"December 29, 2025 / 12:38 IST","Vikran Engineering shares extended gains for a third straight session on Monday after the company won fresh orders in the solar EPC segment. The stock rose 9.54 percent to an intraday high of Rs 110.36 on the NSE. The scrip has climbed over 20 percent in the last three sessions. The buying interest followed the company’s announcement of new project wins in the renewable energy space. The company said it has received letters of award for setting up grid-connected solar power projects with a total capacity of 45.75 MW in Madhya Pradesh. Vikran Engineering will act as the renewable power generator and will be responsible for implementation and operation of the plants. It also secured two other solar projects last week in Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh with a combined value of Rs 2,500 crore, the company said. Chairman and Managing Director Rakesh Markhedkar told CNBC-TV18 that the company has near-term visibility of additional potential order inflows of about Rs 2,000 crore and expects to start FY27 with an order book of Rs 5,500–5,700 crore. The stock has gained 13.6 percent since its market debut in September. Earlier, the firm had bagged an order worth over Rs 2,000 crore from Onix Renewables for the development of 600 MW solar projects across Maharashtra.

207,Business,Hindustan Copper hit fresh 52-week high amid surging global metal prices; stock up 36% in 7-day run,"December 29, 2025 / 12:37 IST","Hindustan Copper shares extended gains for the seventh straight session on Monday, rising nearly 15 percent to hit a fresh 52-week high amid a rally in global metal prices. The stock climbed as much as 14.79 percent to an intraday high of Rs 545.95, which also marked its new 52-week high. It opened the session with a gap-up of about 14.6 percent and maintained the upward momentum through the day. With this, the stock has gained more than 36 percent in the last seven trading sessions. The company's market capitalization also briefly touched the Rs 50,000 crore mark. Monday’s rally was the sharpest single-day rise in the stock since April 2010, following a surge in copper prices to record levels on the London Metal Exchange. Copper futures on the Multi Commodity Exchange of India also hit a fresh record high, tracking gains in overseas markets. Prices were supported by tight supplies, supportive US economic data, expectations of interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve and a weaker dollar. A weaker dollar typically makes dollar-denominated commodities more attractive for holders of other currencies, thereby boosting demand. The Nifty Metal index hit a fresh 52-week high today, gaining around 5 percent in eight sessions so far. ""The sharp rise in metal stocks is being supported by a favourable global macro setup rather than a single trigger,"" said Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS. ""Recent sessions saw Nifty Metal and key names like Hindustan Copper, Hindalco, Vedanta and SAIL push to fresh highs, aided by broad-based buying across ferrous and non-ferrous counters. Turnover has picked up, signalling institutional interest returning after a weak November,"" he added. Metal stocks rise for 8th day as global prices soar, Hind Copper, SAIL shares jump up to 15% Looking ahead, momentum in metal stocks could sustain, though volatility cannot be ruled out, said Dasani.

208,Business,"PNB shares fall up to 3% as PSU bank reports Rs 2,434-cr loan fraud against ex-promoters of Srei Group to RBI","December 29, 2025 / 10:48 IST","Shares of Punjab National Bank fell as much as 3.1% to Rs 116.6 apiece on December 29 as the PSU bank reported a loan fraud of Rs 2,434 crore committed by former promoters of SREI Equipment Finance Ltd (SEFL) and SREI Infrastructure Finance Ltd (SIFL) to the Reserve Bank of India. These two entities with financial debt amounting to Rs 32,700 crore went through resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and the new promoter National Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd (NARCL) acquired them in December 2023. The bank has reported a case of borrowing fraud to the RBI against the erstwhile promoters of SEFL and SIFL, amounting to Rs 1,240.94 crore and Rs 1,193.06 crore, respectively, PNB said in a regulatory filing. At 10:35 am on December 29, PNB shares were trading 0.4% lower at Rs 119.92 apiece and were on track to snap three months of gains. So far in 2025, the stock gained 17%. The bank has already made 100% provisions against the entire outstanding amount, it said. The Reserve Bank of India, in October 2021, superseded the boards of SIFL and its wholly-owned subsidiary SEFL. The Kolkata-based Kanorias previously controlled the twin companies, SIFL and SEFL, until the RBI superseded their boards over alleged mismanagement and subsequently initiated IBC proceedings. SREI began its journey in 1989 as an asset financing NBFC, with Hemant Kanoria as the key face of SIFL. PNB had reported a 14% rise in standalone net profit at Rs 4,904 crore for the September quarter of FY26 as against Rs 4,303 crore in the year-ago period. Operating profit in July-September was at Rs 7,227 crore and Rs 14,308 crore in April-September (H1) FY26, recording a growth of 5.46% and 6.51%, respectively on year-on-year basis. The Nifty PSU Bank index was trading lower for fourth straight day on December 29 with Union Bank of India, Bank of India leading the losses. ""For the immediate future, the stocks of PSU banks are likely to remain volatile. Although the asset quality ratios, capital adequacy, and balance sheet strength of the banks have shown improvement, the valuations have started undergoing consolidation, coming after the recent rally. The coming times would be stock-specific, with earnings performance and policy cues playing important roles in determining the course,"" said Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director, Vibhavangal Anukulakara Pvt Ltd.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/pnb-shares-fall-up-to-3-as-psu-bank-reports-rs-2-434-cr-loan-fraud-against-ex-promoters-of-srei-group-to-rbi-13746225.html
209,Markets,"Metal stocks rise for 8th day as global prices soar, Hind Copper, SAIL shares jump up to 15%; what lies ahead?","December 29, 2025 / 10:50 IST","The shares of metal companies surged for the eighth consecutive session on December 29, with heavyweights like Hindustan Copper, SAIL, Tata Steel and others surging up to 15 percent. Analysts have decoded the reasons behind the recent surge in the stocks, and what lies ahead. The sharp rise in the metal stocks today pushed the Nifty Metal index up 1.5 percent to 10,967.75, as seen at 9.55 am on Monday. Earlier during the day, the index hit a fresh 52-week high of 10,983.20. The index has now gained around 5 percent in eight sessions of gains so far. Why are metal stocks rising? The sharp rise in the metal stocks has been supported by a favourable global macro setup rather than a single trigger, said Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS. ""Recent sessions saw Nifty Metal and key names like Hindustan Copper, Hindalco, Vedanta and SAIL push to fresh highs, aided by broad-based buying across ferrous and non-ferrous counters. Turnover has picked up, signalling institutional interest returning after a weak November,"" the analyst said. Fed rate cut hopes: The sharp rise in metal stocks comes on the back of rising metal prices, due to expectations of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in US in 2026, said Aditya Welekar, Senior Research Analyst - Metals, Axis Securities. ""The easing labor market in the U.S. provides the Fed with the opportunity to lower rates, which bodes well for the metals market,"" he said. China's policy support: A key driver has been China, where incremental policy support for infrastructure, power grids, renewable energy and urban redevelopment is improving demand visibility for steel, copper, aluminium and zinc, Dasani added. “While the property sector remains weak, state-led capex and industrial activity have stabilised, helping metal prices find a floor,” he said. Tight supply: Tight inventories across several base metals have further limited downside risk despite uneven global growth, said Dasani. Welekar from Axis Securities also noted that the supply side for both precious metals and base metals like copper and aluminum is constrained, while demand remains strong. ""The demand for silver and base metals is largely driven by the ongoing needs of electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy, and advancements in artificial intelligence (AI),"" he added. Softer US dollar: Another important tailwind has been the softer US dollar. ""With markets pricing in a gradual easing cycle in the US, the dollar index has eased from recent highs, supporting dollar-denominated commodities. Lower real yields have also improved the relative attractiveness of metals. On the supply side, mining disruptions, higher energy costs and stricter environmental norms have constrained fresh capacity additions, particularly in refined metals, just as demand from energy transition themes such as electric vehicles, power transmission and renewable infrastructure remains steady,"" said Dasani. Rally in commodity prices: The current rally in gold, silver, and copper reflects a tightening physical supply environment rather than just paper-market enthusiasm, said Charmi Shah, Business Head at Wealth1. ""Silver and copper have been running structural deficits for years. In silver, demand from solar, electronics, and EV supply chains has consistently outpaced mine supply, while inventories across major exchanges remain thin. Copper, central to electrification and energy transition themes, continues to face underinvestment in new mines, long gestation periods, and declining ore grades. These constraints are now becoming visible in pricing,"" she said. Gold's strength, meanwhile, is being reinforced by aggressive central bank accumulation across emerging markets, particularly as countries seek diversification away from fiat currencies and sovereign debt, Shah said, adding that China’s buying interest across gold, silver, and industrial metals has further amplified the rally, especially at a time when global supply chains remain fragile. Top metal gainers today: Hindustan Copper shares jumped around 7 percent to trade at Rs 508.05 apiece.  Earlier during the day, the stock jumped around 15 percent to hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 545.95 apiece. This comes as copper prices hit new all-time high levels. Copper hit a record high of $12,960 a ton earlier in the session on benchmark three month copper on the London Metal Exchange. Steel Authority of India (SAIL) shares followed, rising over 4 percent. Tata Steel, Vedanta and Jindal Steel & Power shares rose more than 2 percent each. Hindustan Zinc shares gained nearly 2 percent, while APL Apollo Tubes and JSW Steel shares gained more than 1 percent each. Welspun Corp and Hindalco Industries shares gained nearly 1 percent each, while National Aluminium (NALCO), NMDC and Adani Enterprises shares were trading in the green with marginal gains. What lies ahead? Looking ahead, momentum in metal stocks could sustain, though volatility cannot be ruled out, said Dasani. Global steel demand is projected to grow only modestly through 2030, but ex-China consumption and infrastructure spending in emerging markets should still underpin a gradual uptrend in volumes. In India, government capex and housing demand remain key tailwinds for steel makers, the analyst added. Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director at Vibhavangal Anukulakara said that metals are still vulnerable to changes in global demand, currency fluctuations and rate expectations. Hence the rise can go on, but there will be bouts of volatility and occasional pullbacks as markets digest macro data and look for global growth drivers, according to the analyst. For the near term, the trade looks supported as long as the dollar stays soft and the Fed leans dovish, but any abrupt US data surprise or fresh concerns around China’s exports could trigger sharp corrections, Dasani noted, adding that for investors, this is a classic cyclical rally: focus on balance-sheet strength and cost-efficient producers rather than chasing every spike.

210,Markets,"Defence shares rise for 5th day ahead of DAC meeting today; Paras Defence, Mazagon Dock lead gains","December 26, 2025 / 10:57 IST","Defence shares rose for fifth consecutive session on December 26 amid geopolitical tensions flaring up in different parts of the world and year-end Defence Acquisition Council meeting today. Defence major Bharat Electronics traded over 1% higher, and was the best performing Nifty 50 stock. Outside the Nifty 50, shares of Paras Defence and Space Technologies, Mtar Technologies, and Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders were up 2–3% and the Nifty India Defence index was up 1%, higher than any other sectoral index. A report said that defence deals worth Rs 80,000 crore are likely to be approved by Rajnath Singh-led DAC on December 26. Several defence deals may be cleared to strengthen air defence and ISR capabilities, reported ET NOW. Procurement of Embraer-based Airborne Early Warning System, NETRA AEW integration are on agenda, the report added. The rise in defence shares today also comes on the back of US ordering increased economic pressure on Venezuelan oil shipments and carrying out airstrikes against Islamic State militants in northwest Nigeria at the request of Nigeria's government. Both Venezuela and Nigeria are major oil producers. While Nigeria's oilfields are mainly located in the south of the country, the airstrikes added to geopolitical risks. The White House has ordered US military forces to focus on a ""quarantine"" of Venezuelan oil for at least the next two months, indicating Washington is currently more interested in using economic rather than military means to pressure Caracas. There are also expectations in the upcoming FY27 Budget that defence budget could rise up to 20%. India is expected to push for a significantly higher defence allocation in the next fiscal, Defence Secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh said last month. Speaking at the 98th Annual General Meeting of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI), he noted that the country has traditionally received a “10% higher defence allocation every year.” “We are in a particularly tough neighbourhood,” Singh said. “Will be asking closer to 20% higher allocation in coming budget.” At 10:30 am on December 26, Nifty India Defence index was trading 1% higher at 7,870, thus extending its five-session gains to 6.5%.

215,Markets,Daily Voice: Nimesh Chandan bullish on earnings growth acceleration next year; double-digit profit growth seen in H2FY26,"December 29, 2025 / 07:44 IST","Earnings growth is set to accelerate as we move into 2026, said Nimesh Chandan, Chief Investment Officer at Bajaj Finserv Asset Management. He expects corporate profit growth to move closer to double-digit in the second half of FY26 and further accelerate into the mid-teens in FY27. According to him, the Fed’s December move likely marks the end of its rapid easing phase. January looks more like a pause than a pivot as markets are pricing less than a one-in-four chance of another cut, he said in an interview to Moneycontrol. Among sectors, he is constructive on non-ferrous metals as a basket and believes they should do well over the next year. Do you believe US Federal Reserve will make the final benchmark interest rate cut of its current easing cycle in January 2026, followed by a possibility—but not a confirmation—of another rate cut later in the year? The Fed’s December move likely marks the end of its rapid easing phase. January looks more like a pause than a pivot as markets are pricing less than a one-in-four chance of another cut. The committee’s own projections point to just one reduction in 2026, and that’s conditional on inflation staying benign and growth softening further. Our base case is a hold in January, with scope for a cut in March if data cooperates. Beyond that, the Fed will tread carefully; policy credibility matters more than speed. Investors should prepare for a slower, data-dependent path rather than a straight line to lower rates. Are you confident that earnings growth is set to accelerate next year? Yes, we remain confident that earnings growth is set to accelerate as we move into 2026. We expect corporate profit growth to move closer to double-digit in the second half of FY26 and further accelerate into the mid-teens in FY27. This improvement is being underpinned by a gradual pickup in economic activity, which should translate into healthier revenue growth for Nifty 500 companies. At the same time, a relatively benign and soft commodity cost environment is likely to support margin expansion. The combination of improving top-line growth and stable-to-improving margins should result in strong earnings growth, which, in turn, should provide support to market returns over the next year. With consistent Fed funds rate cuts, expectations of strong earnings visibility, and the possibility of an India–US trade deal sooner rather than later, do you expect FII outflows to stop soon and 2026 to witness net inflows? FII flows are influenced by multiple and often shifting factors. When we look at India’s positioning relative to other emerging markets, India continues to stand out as a clear bright spot. The combination of relatively stronger economic growth, macro stability and political certainty, with a stable government at the helm, places India in a favourable position to attract capital flows that are directed towards emerging markets. These structural positives provide a strong foundation for investor confidence. In addition, once the resolution of trade-related uncertainties plays out, they should help restore India’s competitiveness in export markets and bring greater stability to the currency. Taken together, these factors are likely to reinforce foreign investor confidence and improve the environment for capital inflows over the period ahead. Do you see the market recording a rally of more than 10 percent even in 2026? If you look at the track record, the Nifty has delivered positive returns in every calendar year for the last 10 years, which is quite rare and something very few equity markets globally have managed to achieve. That consistency itself speaks to the underlying strength of the Indian market. As we move into 2026, with earnings growth expected to pick up, we believe the Nifty is well placed to continue delivering positive returns. Importantly, it is not just the headline index. Broader market performance over the last year or so has lagged the Nifty, and we expect a recovery there as well. As earnings growth improves, uncertainties around trade-related issues reduce, and some of the geopolitical tensions ease, the overall environment should turn more supportive for equities. Do you think the commercial vehicle segment within the auto space will make a strong comeback next year? The commercial vehicle segment has not gone through a typical sharp downturn over the last few years. A recovery is clearly underway, and we believe the segment is already in the process of picking up momentum. Over the last few months, we have started to see early green shoots of recovery, both in key lead indicators and in commercial vehicle sales data. Typically, commercial vehicles tend to act as an early indicator of an economic pickup. Since we expect the broader economy to improve, the commercial vehicle segment should benefit from that trend as well. While the upturn may be relatively shallow, we do expect a recovery to continue, with the last quarter of the current fiscal also shaping up to be supportive for the segment. Do you see the rupee bottoming out soon? Foreign portfolio outflows, a slow year for FDI coupled with tariff worries put some pressure on the Rupee. India’s fundamentals, meanwhile, stayed solid, growth held up, inflation was at all-time lows and the current account avoided stress. It’s possible that next year we may see recovery. We expect a softer dollar, steadier trade post the trade deal, and a return of risk appetite in global portfolio flows. FDI prospects also look good for 2026. With imports slowing and the trade balance improving, the rupee has a stronger foundation for recovery. Do you expect export-oriented companies to see strong earnings uplift due to rupee depreciation? Yes, we do believe that export-oriented sectors such as Pharmaceuticals and IT could see an earnings uplift from the Rupee depreciation. Currency movement can provide a near-term tailwind and may result in a near term benefit for these sectors. However, over the longer term, earnings performance will continue to be driven by the underlying fundamentals of the businesses rather than currency alone. Within this context, we remain constructive on the Pharma sector, where fundamentals are supportive, and we are overweight there. In contrast, the outlook for the IT sector is likely to remain more volatile, driven by policy actions in the US and the growth trajectory of the US and European economies. Do you see strong opportunities in non-ferrous metals in 2026? We have been bullish on metals throughout last year. Historically, every rate-cut cycle tends to be accompanied by an uptick in the commodity cycle, as lower rates and expectations around growth provide support to commodity prices. In that context, the recent set of rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve have already started to boost commodity prices, including non-ferrous metals. A sustained upcycle in non-ferrous metals will continue to depend on the pace of economic activity in developed markets as well as in China. These two regions remain critical drivers for demand. We are therefore closely monitoring how these macro variables evolve. Overall, we are constructive on non-ferrous metals as a basket and believe they should do well over the next year. However, the extent and durability of the upside will be influenced by how global economic conditions play out.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/daily-voice-nimesh-chandan-bullish-on-earnings-growth-acceleration-next-year-double-digit-profit-growth-seen-in-h2fy26-13745754.html
216,Markets,"Sensex falls nearly 500 pts from day's high, Nifty below 26,000: 5 key reasons behind market decline","December 29, 2025 / 11:33 IST","The benchmark equity indices Sensex and Nifty gave up early gains and slipped into the red in thin year-end trade on Monday, dragged down by continued foreign fund outflows and higher crude prices. In early trading, the Sensex rose to an intraday high of 85,250, gaining 209 points or 0.24 percent, while the broader Nifty climbed to 26,106.80, up 64.5 points or 0.24 percent. The benchmarks, however, soon failed to sustain the upward momentum. At around 11:30 a.m., the Sensex retreated by nearly 500 points from the day’s high to 84,763.91, down 277.55 points or 0.33 percent, while the Nifty slipped to 25,966.95, down 75.35 points or 0.29 percent. Market breadth also turned negative as about 1424 shares advanced, 2319 shares declined and 171 shares unchanged. Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, Power Grid Corporation of India and Shriram Finance were among the major laggards in the Nifty50 pack, declining up to 2 percent, while Tata Steel and JSW Steel were the key gainers, rising up to 3 percent as metal shares rose due to surgning metal prices in international markets. Key reasons behind the market decline 1) Thin year-end trade volumes: The investors remained cautious amid low trading activity towards the end of the year. The Nifty50’s average daily trading volume in December stood at about 250 million shares, down from 300 million shares in November. ""With the holiday season and calendar-year close, trading volumes remain thin due to subdued year-end participation, keeping markets muted,"" Aakash Shah, research analyst at Choice Broking told Reuters. 2) Persistent FII selling: Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) sold equities worth Rs 317.56 crore on Friday, marking the fourth consecutive session of net outflows. The sustained selling pressure dented investor sentiment and capped any meaningful upside in domestic stocks. Stock Market LIVE Updates 3) Rise in crude oil prices: Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, rose 1.04 percent to USD 61.27 per barrel. Higher crude prices tend to raise India’s import bill and stoke inflation concerns, which weighs on equity markets. 4) Weak global cues: US markets ended flat on Friday and US futures were trading on a subdued note on Monday morning India time, indicating a muted opening overseas. In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 index was trading lower. ""A strong rebound in the market needs a trigger like a US-India trade deal with favourable tariffs for India. There is no clarity yet on when this will happen. Therefore, a consolidation phase is likely in the near term and investors can use this phase to slowly accumulate high-quality stocks with preference for largecaps,"" said Dr V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments Limited. 5) Decline in Rupee: The rupee depreciated 5 paise to 89.95 against the US dollar in early trade amid foreign fund outflows and a weak opening in domestic equities. At the interbank foreign exchange, the local unit opened at 89.95 against the dollar, down from the previous close of 89.90. On Friday, the rupee had declined 19 paise. Technical view According to Anand James, Chief Market Strategist at Geojit Investments Limited, Nifty is trading close to its 20-day simple moving average. ""An early pullback is possible, but a move above 26,127–26,150 is needed to confirm strength. Failure to hold above 26,050–26,077 could lead to further downside towards 25,935–25,850, and possibly 25,740–25,650, though the latter is less likely today,"" he said.

217,Markets,Moneycontrol Pro Market Outlook | Markets poised for cautious start to 2026 amid global cues,"December 29, 2025 / 07:18 IST","Dear Reader, During the holiday-shortened trading week, Indian equity indices traded within a narrow range, with broader market segments outperforming their benchmarks. The Nifty50 edged up 0.29 percent, while the smallcap index gained a full percentage point and the midcap index advanced 0.3 percent. Sectoral performance showed notable divergence. Defence stocks led the rally with gains exceeding 3 percent, followed by metal stocks, which climbed 2.7 percent, and media stocks, which added 1 percent. On the losing side, PSU Bank stocks shed nearly 1 percent, while both IT and pharmaceutical stocks declined 0.3 percent each. Foreign institutional investors maintained their selling pressure throughout the truncated final week of 2025, offloading Indian equities worth Rs 4,290.96 crore. Trading volumes, which typically thin out as the year draws to a close, remained predictably subdued. Hopes for a traditional year-end or ""Santa Claus"" rally dissipated as FII selling persisted amid limited visibility on progress in US-India trade negotiations. There were some positive developments, however. The Reserve Bank of India's liquidity interventions—executed through open market operations and a USD/INR buy-sell swap—helped stabilise the rupee, though persistent FII outflows continued to dampen market sentiment.  The US markets advanced during the shortened trading week, with both the S&P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching record highs. The week's standout performers were gold and silver, which surged higher and continued their impressive year-to-date rally. Economic data painted a robust picture of US growth. According to preliminary figures released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis on Tuesday, the US economy expanded at its fastest pace in two years during the third quarter. GDP grew at an annual rate of 4.3 percent in the three months through September, accelerating from the second quarter's 3.8 percent growth and comfortably exceeding market estimates of around 3 percent. Despite GDP surpassing consensus forecasts, market scepticism remained evident, as other indicators—particularly consumption and employment data—failed to corroborate the strong headline number. Adding to concerns, the US Consumer Confidence Index declined for the fifth consecutive month in December, falling to 89.1 from November's upwardly revised reading of 92.9 and missing expectations of 91.5. Looking ahead, the final week of 2025 is expected to remain subdued as investors prepare for the upcoming earnings season amid characteristically low trading volumes. As we transition into 2026, market direction will be shaped by three key factors: currency volatility, foreign institutional investor flows, and developments in India-US trade discussions. Nifty at a Crossroads Nifty ended the week on a marginally positive note, yet daily sentiment indicators suggest the short term has entered overbought territory. This leaves us watching critical levels as the new week begins: Will Nifty hold above 23,800, or will it break lower? Is this a market gradually losing strength, or have we seen the worst? The Banking sector registered its third consecutive weekly decline. Both indices are forming a series of doji candles—a telltale sign of indecisive weeks as the market awaits a clear directional signal. The daily swing, a short-term momentum indicator, tells an instructive story. Recent readings above 80 have consistently triggered market pullbacks, and this week proved no exception. While a deviation from this pattern is anticipated, it hasn't materialised yet. Now the focus shifts to waiting for the swing to turn upward and for Nifty to establish a higher bottom above 23,726.  Source: web.strike.money FIIs have shown little appetite for covering their short positions. It's been over a year since they held a net long position in index futures. Throughout this period, their net position has oscillated between -190,000 and -10,000 contracts, with only brief and ultimately false breakouts beyond these boundaries. More recently, they haven't even managed to breach -113,335 contracts. In recent days, there were signs they might cover more shorts as an upward trend began emerging in their positions. However, Friday's session halted that momentum. This persistent bearish positioning has prevented the market from falling sharply, yet it has also failed to generate sufficient positive momentum for a sustained multi-week rally.  Source: web.strike.money The Open Interest Put/Call ratio has remained range-bound for over a year. Readings near 0.95 have consistently marked market tops, with the most recent occurrence last month. Conversely, readings near 0.77 have signalled bottoms, and the market did indeed advance from those levels. What's notable now is that the indicator hasn't returned to the overbought zone. Could this suggest more upside remains ahead? One can hope.  Source: web.strike.money Sector Rotation Nifty 50 – The Benchmark Index ended higher by +0.29% this week and closed at 26042.30.

218,Markets,Coforge shares rise even as analysts say $2.35-bn deal to buy Encora 'bold' but earnings dilutive,"December 29, 2025 / 10:23 IST","The shares of Coforge rose more than 2 percent in the morning trading hours of December 29 after the IT firm said that it will acquire US-based engineering services company Encora in a $2.35-billion all-stock transaction. The shares of the IT firm rose to Rs 1,711 apiece in the early trading hours of Monday, snapping a three-session losing streak. This comes even as brokerages remain divergent about their views on the impact of the acquisition of the AI firm. Coforge to acquire US-based AI firm Encora: In an exchange filing released in the post market hours of December 26, Coforge said that the acquisition will be executed through a share swap, under which the company will issue 93.8 million equity shares at Rs 1,815.91 apiece, implying a non-cash consideration of about Rs 17,032 crore. Encora shareholders will hold about 21.25 percent of Coforge’s post-issue equity capital. ""Coforge's acquisition of Encora will create a $2.5 billion Tech Services powerhouse with both the scale and capability across AI-led engineering, Cloud, and Data services to drive enterprise-grade AI-solutions,"" a release by the company read after it concluded its board meeting. Earlier, Moneycontrol exclusively reported that Coforge is in advanced discussions to acquire Encora, potentially marking one of the largest transactions in the digital engineering space, citing sources. Here's what brokerages say: Macquarie remained bullish on the shares of the company, double-upgrading its rating to 'Outperform' from 'Underperform' and raising its target price to Rs 2,230 apiece. This implies an upside potential of over 33 percent from the stock's previous closing price. The international brokerage believes that the acquisition of Encora will improve Coforge's service portfolio, and view this deal as a positive in the long term as it can accelerate Coforge's revenue growth, according to CNBC-TV18. Macquarie now expects longer-term sustainable revenue growth to be 15-18 percent. Elara Capital downgraded Coforge shares to ‘Reduce’ from ‘Accumulate’, and lowered its target price for the stock to Rs 1,720 per share from Rs 2,120 per share. The latest target price implies an upside potential of nearly 3 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The domestic brokerage noted that the acquisition will possibly help Coforge address its gaps in the North American market. However, valuations at EV/sales of 3.9x appear expensive considering that Encora posted only 7-10 percent organic revenue growth in the past two years, lower than Coforge’s revenue growth, it added. “Historically (in FY21-25), Coforge had reported high teen revenue CAGR on account of stable management, strong order book and specialization in select verticals of BFS, Insurance and Travel. Encora’s organic revenue growth, on the other ha nd, was lower at 7-10%. Despite lower growth, COFORGE is acquiring Encora at 3.9X EV/sales and ~21x EV/EBITDA, in line with COFORGE ’s multiples, which appears expensive. So, we cut our target multiple for COFORGE from 39x to 34x to reflect higher valuation concern. Organically also, some costs for COFORGE witnessed an uptick in recent quarters, which may strain its margins, going ahead. Thus, we cut our earnings estimates by 7–8% for FY27E and FY28E, respectively,” it said. Motilal Oswal Financial Services noted that the scale of transaction is large, therefore execution remains critical. Integration, leadership retention, margin management post-integration, and amortization will be the key monitorables. It however said that the vertical mix, primarily hi-tech and healthcare, is a positive, especially given Coforge’s strategic intent to scale these segments. “We believe Coforge’s strong executable order book and resilient client spending across verticals bode well for its organic business. This acquisition expands Coforge’s presence in the Hi-Tech and Healthcare verticals, though we have not yet incorporated Encora's numbers into our valuation. We continue to view Coforge as a structurally strong mid-tier player well-placed to benefit from vendor consolidation/cost-takeout deals and digital transformation,” the domestic brokerage said, while reiterating its ‘Buy’ call on the stock and a target price of Rs 2,500 per share, implying an upside potential of 49 percent. JM Financial said that the valuation looks rich given Encora’s 7 – 10 percent growth profile, CNBC-TV18 reported. Morgan Stanley analysts called the deal a ""bold move"", but said that the price tag appears expensive and is likely to be dilutive to earnings. Coforge's preference share issue creates an overhang once the lock-in period ends, Morgan Stanley added, forecasting a 12–13 percent decline in the stock. DAM Capital analysts said deal to be EPS dilutive, especially since price paid is higher than the firm's current valuation.

223,Markets,OPINION | Indian equity markets in a volatile 2025 displayed resilience,"December 29, 2025 / 13:32 IST","2025 was a testament to the enduring resilience of Indian equity markets. Despite encountering periods of heightened volatility and a measured start after the remarkable gains of 2024, our markets demonstrated their ability to adapt and recover. Global headwinds—including evolving US trade policies and ongoing geopolitical tensions—introduced intermittent uncertainty, yet their impact was effectively managed and contained. Renewed momentum in the second half What stands out most is the renewed momentum we witnessed in the latter part of the year. This resurgence propelled both the Sensex and Nifty towards new lifetime highs, reaffirming the robust fundamentals and long-term potential of the India growth story. As we look ahead, I remain confident that our market’s underlying strength and adaptability will continue to drive sustainable value for all stakeholders. Economic developments of 2025 that helped # Robust Growth Momentum: India’s economy continues to outperform expectations, with real GDP growth reaching 7.8% and 8.2% year-on-year in Q1 and Q2 FY26, respectively. # Supportive Monetary Policy: The RBI’s proactive stance—easing liquidity and cutting the repo rate by 125 basis points—has started to stimulate credit growth. With inflation remaining benign, there is potential for further rate reductions. # Tax and Regulatory Reforms: The government’s move to simplify GST rates from five to three slabs marks a significant reform. Lower GST rates across various products and services, along with reduced income tax rates in the Union Budget 2025, are expected to boost disposable incomes, especially for the middle class, with positive effects likely to be seen in the latter half of the fiscal year and beyond. # Rural Demand Strengthening: A favourable monsoon and low inflation have lifted rural consumer confidence, setting the stage for stronger demand in the coming quarters. A snapshot of market performance Stability in Large Caps, Pressure in Small Caps: Market performance in 2025 showed a clear divergence across segments. While key benchmark indices like the Nifty 50 TRI (+11%) and BSE Sensex TRI (+10%) delivered steady returns (January 1 to December 15), and the broader BSE 200 TRI gained nearly 9%, mid-cap stocks saw moderate growth (+5% on the Nifty Midcap 150 TRI). In contrast, small-cap stocks corrected sharply, with the BSE Small Cap TRI falling by about 7%. Despite headline indices trading near all-time highs, market breadth was weak—only 14% of Nifty 500 stocks were close to their 52-week highs, and over half were down 20% or more from their peaks. This indicates that index gains were driven by a narrow group of stocks, underscoring the importance of selective, fundamentally driven investment strategies (Bloomberg. Data period Jan 1 to Dec 22, 2025 closing period has been considered.) Sectoral Trends: Metals shine, Realty cracks 2025 has seen significant divergence in sectoral performance. The BSE Metal index delivered strong returns of over 23%, while the BSE Auto TRI gained around 20%, supported by demand recovery and improved operating efficiencies. Banking and financial services also performed well, posting gains of about 16%, driven by healthy balance sheets and steady credit growth. However, some sectors faced challenges during the year. Information Technology sector declined by around 12%. Consumer Durables and Real Estate also ended the year in negative territory, with real estate declining by over 16 (Data period Jan 1 to Dec 15, 2025). FIIs and DIIs – DIIs shine as Indian savings steps in In 2025, the Indian market saw a clear divide between foreign and domestic investors. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) withdrew funds in 7 out of 11 months, resulting in net outflows of Rs 1,43,675 crore. In contrast, Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs), especially mutual funds, consistently injected capital every month, with net inflows totaling Rs 6,85,421 crore (AMFI Data as on Jan 1 to Nov 28, 2025). This resilience was largely supported by disciplined retail investors through systematic investment plans (SIPs), which played a key role in maintaining market stability during volatile periods Mutual fund asset base grows - Hybrid mutual funds lead the rise The mutual fund industry demonstrated robust growth across all major categories, underpinned by strong retail investor participation and consistent inflows, especially through SIPs. Strong Growth in AUM: The domestic mutual fund industry’s assets under management (AUM) surged by 20.25%, rising from Rs 66.99 lakh crore in January to approximately Rs 80.55 lakh crore in November 2025.Retail Investor Confidence: Retail participation remains a key driver, supported by increased digital adoption, affordable SIPs, and greater financial awareness.Hybrid Funds: Assets in hybrid funds grew by 24.28% to Rs 10.88 lakh crore, with a net inflow of Rs 145,886 crore, mainly due to gains in dynamic asset allocation/balanced advantage funds.Open-ended Equity Funds: These funds saw a 21.01% rise in assets to Rs 35.65 lakh crore, with net inflows of Rs 322,098 crore.Open-ended Debt Funds: Assets increased by 13.43% to Rs 19.35 lakh crore, with net inflows of Rs 229,221 crore.SIP Collections: Systematic investment plan (SIP) collections continued their upward trend, reaching Rs 303,978 crore by November 2025 (AMFI Data as on Jan 1 to Nov 28, 2025). Gold and silver deliver superb returns Gold and silver broke records in 2025. Silver reached record levels in 2025 posting outstanding returns, its best returns in decades led by strong industrial demands. Gold prices also climbed strongly in 2025 gaining around 70% due to safe haven demand amid rising global uncertainty. Road ahead India’s growth trajectory remains robust and forward-looking. The domestic macroeconomic environment continues to provide a solid foundation, underpinned by moderating inflation, the prospect of monetary easing, strong government-led capital expenditure, ample liquidity, and ongoing structural reforms. While near-term global uncertainties may result in range-bound markets, India’s investment cycle is well-positioned for further acceleration over the medium term, fueled by significant advancements in infrastructure, manufacturing, renewable energy, and supply-chain localisation. We maintain a constructive outlook on equities over the long term, viewing periods of market volatility as strategic opportunities to build high-quality portfolios. On the fixed income side, favourable inflation dynamics and a well-managed current account deficit create a supportive backdrop, further reinforced by stable price levels and improving external balances. Looking ahead to 2026, we believe that a well-diversified allocation across equities, fixed income, and commodities will be instrumental in navigating market volatility and capturing opportunities amid an evolving geopolitical landscape.

The spot price of silver hit an all-time high at $82.95 an ounce on December 29 (4:45 am IST), and fell briefly to $80.40 (9:05 am), up 1.55 per cent in a day and 16.38 per cent in a week.

Why are silver prices rising? According to the Augmont Bullion report published on December 24, the spot price of silver has increased by more than 140 per cent, setting new records. ""Silver may consolidate but remains structurally bullish, with many models projecting $65-$80+ through 2026 as tight supply and industrial demand persist,"" said Justin Khoo, Senior Market Analyst - APAC, VT Market Check out below to see the prices of 1 kilogram of 999 purity silver.

Source: Goodreturns Outlook: Will silver regain momentum this week? Justin Khoo predicts that in the near term, silver is vulnerable to tactical profit booking as prices have rallied sharply and are trading well above medium-term averages, which typically invites consolidation. ""Silver’s higher beta versus gold means corrections tend to be faster and deeper. However, any pullback should be viewed as corrective rather than trend-ending, especially while concerns about inflation, fiscal stress, and real-rate uncertainty remain supportive of precious metals. ""The sharp compression in the gold-silver ratio signals relative exhaustion in silver’s outperformance, not a reversal for the metals complex. Historically, such moves are followed by phases where gold stabilises, and silver corrects. This points to rotation within precious metals, not a breakdown,"" said Justin Khoo.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/silver-price-today-futures-hit-all-time-high-of-rs-2-53-lakh-kg-on-mcx-spot-price-near-83-check-rates-in-your-city-13745998.html
226,Markets,"Rs4 lakh crore IPO wave ahead in 2026, says Pantomath","December 29, 2025 / 13:18 IST","India’s primary markets are on the cusp of a major milestone, with nearly Rs4 lakh crore in capital formation expected through IPOs in 2026. But beyond the headline number, the bigger story is that the IPO boom is no longer cyclical — it is becoming structural, according to Pantomath Capital’s Primary Pulse 2025 report. The study finds that India now leads the world in IPO volumes and has firmly transitioned from opportunistic listing waves to steady, broad-based capital mobilisation. Mainboard IPOs crossed the 100-deal mark in 2025 — the first time since 2007 — supported by a healthy mix of offerings across sizes, particularly in the Rs100–500 crore and Rs1,000–2,000 crore bands. Unlike markets dominated by a few blockbuster issues, India’s pipeline reflects continuity and depth. Crucially, the quality of capital deployment is improving. More than three-quarters of IPO proceeds are being channelled toward expansion, capacity creation, working capital and debt reduction — signalling productive investment rather than financial restructuring. Fund mobilisation has been led by financial services, followed by manufacturing, industrials and consumption-linked sectors, aligning closely with India’s long-term growth themes, the report said. The report also added that the investor participation is widening alongside. While Mumbai remains the anchor, strong demand is emerging from Gujarat hubs such as Ahmedabad, Surat and Rajkot — and increasingly from non-metro centres like Bhilai, Kendrapara and Hisar, highlighting the democratisation of equity investing, it said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ipo/rs4-lakh-crore-ipo-wave-ahead-in-2026-says-pantomath-13746637.html
227,Markets,Hindustan Zinc shares fall 5% intraday as silver prices drop 8% from lifetime highs,"December 29, 2025 / 13:18 IST","The shares of Hindustan Zinc sharply fell more than 5 percent from their intraday high on December 29 as silver prices declined after a sharp surge. The shares of the Vedanta Group-company erased all morning gains and fell more than 2 percent to trade at Rs 622.25 apiece in the afternoon. This came after the stock hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 656.35 earlier during the day. Silver prices decline: After hitting an all-time high of Rs 2,54,174 per kg, silver futures with March expiry on MCX fell more than 8 percent to Rs 2,33,120 per kg. The futures contracts with May and July expiries also erased all gains, falling 9 percent and 10 percent respectively after hitting fresh lifetime highs during the day. This comes after the precious and industrial metal saw a record bull run. ""A combination of profit-taking and seemingly productive talks between Trump and Zelensky regarding a potential peace deal have put gold, silver on the back foot,"" said KCM Trade Chief Market Analyst Tim Waterer, as quoted by Reuters. ""Rate cuts and a continuation of robust industrial appetite paired with supply shortages could have silver primed for a run towards $100 in 2026,"" Waterer added. The recent surge in Hindustan Zinc shares was mostly driven by the sharp rise in silver prices. Hindustan Zinc is the largest producer of silver in India, and produces refined silver with a minimum 99.9 percent purity. Hence, the intraday fall in silver prices may have impacted Hindustan Zinc’s share price. Hindustan Zinc share price: Despite today's fall, Hindustan Zinc shares have gained nearly 4 percent in the past five days, and around 26 percent in the past one month.

230,Markets,"Bank Nifty falls below 59,000 as IndusInd, ICICI, HDFC Bank shares fall up to 1.5%: Check key levels to watch out for","December 29, 2025 / 13:14 IST","Bank stocks declined on December 29, led by losses in heavyweights including IndusInd Bank, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank. The Nifty Bank index has now declined for the fourth consecutive session. The Nifty Bank index fell 0.32 percent to 58,823.40, as seen at 12.25 pm on Monday. Check key technical levels to watch out for some upside chances or more downside. Technical view on Bank Nifty: Nifty Bank index continued to find it difficult to gain upside traction, facing persistent supply at higher levels and swift profit-booking on even minor intraday recoveries, said SAMCO Securities. ""The overall tone remained cautious and restrained, with the index largely moving within its established trading corridor,"" it said. “From a technical standpoint, the index remains entrenched in a consolidation phase, with the broader range capped near 59,600 on the upside and supported around 58,600 on the downside. The continuation of a lower-high formation keeps 59,500 firmly positioned as a critical pivot for any meaningful trend reversal,” it added. Angel One remained bullish on the index, stating that 59,500 -59,800 remain the key resistance levels to watch for. On the downside, the domestic brokerage sees the index finding support at 58,800 -58,500 levels. The Bank Nifty is consolidating after its recent rally and is respecting key support levels, said Choice Broking. “Immediate support is seen at 58,700–58,800, while resistance is placed at 59,300–59,400. A decisive close above resistance could push the index toward 59,800–60,000, whereas a breakdown may extend consolidation,” it added. According to Ventura's daily updates report, Bank Nifty will find its first support at 58,912, followed by 58,813 and 58,679. On the upper side, the brokerage said that the index will find resistance at 59,145, 59,279 and 59,378. “If the trend is strong Bank Nifty will not breach (58080-57230) area. If these levels are breached one should wait for 56553-(55933-55345). Above 59478 we open for (59713 -60114- 61050—62540—63470) levels. Our view is after minor correction we have a high probability for Bank Nifty to cross 60114 and reach 61050—62540—63470 area,” Ventura said.

233,Markets,PSU Bank stocks fall for 4th day: What should investors do in 2026?,"December 29, 2025 / 11:40 IST","The shares of public sector banks (PSB) dropped in trade on December 29, extending losses for the fourth consecutive session. Analysts have advised what investors should do in the near-term. The fall in the share prices pushed the Nifty PSU Bank index down 0.3 percent to 8,263.55, as seen at 11.20 am on Monday. What lies ahead? For the immediate future, the shares of PSU banks are likely to remain volatile, said Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director at Vibhavangal Anukulakara. Although the asset quality ratios, capital adequacy, and balance sheet strength of the banks have shown improvement, the valuations have started undergoing consolidation, coming after the recent rally, he added. ""The coming times would be stock-specific, with earnings performance and policy cues playing important roles in determining the course,"" the analyst said. Pravesh Gour, Senior Technical Analyst at Swastika Investmart, said that the outperformance seen in PSU Bank stocks recently before the consolidation should be taken by investors both as an opportunity and something that warrants caution. ""PSU bank stocks have emerged as clear leaders in 2025, driven by a rare alignment of strong fundamentals, improving asset quality, and supportive macro conditions. After years of balance sheet stress, most public sector banks have cleaned up their books, with gross and net NPAs falling to multi-year lows. This has reduced credit costs and lifted profitability, allowing PSU banks to report steady growth in return on assets and return on equity. At the same time, robust credit demand from infrastructure, manufacturing, MSMEs, and retail borrowers has supported healthy loan growth, while better capital adequacy has given these banks room to expand without frequent dilution,"" Gour said. He added that valuation re-rating is another key reason behind PSU banks’ dominance. “For a long period, PSU banks traded at deep discounts to private sector peers due to governance concerns and weak earnings visibility. In 2025, as earnings have stabilized and visibility improved, investors have begun to reprice these stocks upward, narrowing the valuation gap. Government support, ongoing reforms, and improved operational efficiency through digitization have further strengthened confidence. In addition, PSU banks tend to benefit directly from higher public capex and policy-led credit growth, making them natural beneficiaries of India’s infrastructure-led growth push,” he said. On the positive side, the structural turnaround suggests that select PSU banks can deliver steady compounding over the long run, supported by improving profitability, stable asset quality, and reasonable valuations compared with private banks, he said. However, investors should be mindful that a significant part of the re-rating has already played out, and returns may normalize from here, the analyst noted. ""Stock selection becomes critical, with a focus on banks that demonstrate consistent earnings growth, strong capital buffers, and disciplined lending. Overall, PSU banks in 2025 reflect a sector in recovery and transition, offering long-term investors a blend of value and growth, provided expectations remain realistic and investment decisions are selective,"" Gour concluded. Top PSU Bank losers today: Central Bank of India shares were the top loser on the Nifty PSU Bank index, falling more than 1 percent to trade at Rs 36.47 apiece. Union Bank of India, Punjab National Bank (PNB), Punjab & Sind Bank (PSB), Bank of India and UCO Bank shares fell around 1 percent each.

238,Markets,"Dalal Street week ahead: Auto sales, FOMC minutes, manufacturing PMI among 10 key factors to watch","December 29, 2025 / 07:08 IST","The market snapped three-week losing streak, closing higher for the truncated week ended December 26. Stronger domestic demand, a favourable liquidity outlook, and hope for continuation of Fed policy easing in 2026 supported market sentiment, however, the market could not sustain all its Santa rally gains as there was pressure at higher levels due to limited progress in US–India trade talks and consistent FII outflow. Meanwhile, gold advanced on safe-haven demand, with futures rising 3.77 percent during the week to end at record closing high of $4,552.7 an ounce while the Brent crude oil futures traded near the lower Bollinger bands, ending 0.28 percent higher at $60.64 a barrel, though experts feel US steps to tighten pressure on Venezuelan oil shipments could exert upward pressure in the near term. The domestic equity markets are expected to be cautious amid rangebound trading with focus on auto sales, FOMC minutes and manufacturing PMI numbers. The monthly F&O expiry-led volatility can't be ruled out in initial part of the week, experts said. The Nifty 50 rose 76 points (0.3 percent) for the week to 26,042, and the BSE Sensex gained 112 points (0.13 percent) to 85,041, while the Nifty Midcap 100 index ended flat and the Nifty Smallcap 100 index rallied 1.75 percent. ""Looking ahead, market sentiment is likely to stay cautious as investors brace for the upcoming earnings season while remaining attuned to global developments and currency movements,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Investments said. According to him, key drivers will include progress in India–US trade talks, rupee stability, FII trends, and movements in commodity prices. ""With year-end trading volumes expected to remain subdued, price action could be largely contained,"" he said. Siddhartha Khemka - Head of Research, Wealth Management at Motilal Oswal Financial Services also expects Indian equities to trade in a narrow range amid lack of triggers, tracking the macro indicators and institutional flows. Here are 10 key factors to watch out for next week: FOMC Minutes The market participants will focus on the minutes of US Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting held on December 9-10. The central bank slashed the federal funds rate by 25 bps to 3.5-3.75 percent range in the said meeting, after the 25-bp reduction each in September and October. Globally, the markets of all asset classes will look for cues with respect to further rate cut path, jobs data, inflation and economic outlook from the minutes. Global Economic Data The focus will also be on the US weekly jobs data, and monthly pending home sales numbers. Apart from this, manufacturing PMI data from the US, Europe, China and other nations will also be watched next week.  New Fed Chair Announcement Globally, in the coming weeks, the market will also keep an eye on the appointment of new US Federal Reserve Chair as US President Donald Trump already said he would be declaring the name of new successor to Powell in early 2026. The decision is expected to shape the monetary policy outlook including whether the new chair will continue rate cut path or not. The term of current Fed Chair Jerome Powell will end in May. Domestic Economic Data Back home, the industrial and manufacturing production numbers for November month will be released on December 29, followed by the RBI's market borrowing auctions on December 30. This follows the fiscal deficit for November and external debt data for September 2025 quarter which scheduled on December 31. On the final working day of the week i.e. January 2, the focus will be on the manufacturing PMI data for December month, bank loan & deposit growth for fortnight ended December 12, and foreign exchange reserves for week ended December 26. The preliminary estimates indicated that the manufacturing PMI dropped to 55.7 in December, compared to 56.6 in November. Auto Sales Auto stocks - Tata Motor, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicle, Mahindra & Mahindra, Eicher Motors, Ashok Leyland, Maruti Suzuki, Bajaj Auto, Hero MotoCorp, Hyundai Motor India, TVS Motor, Escorts etc - will also be in focus as automobile companies will release their December sales volume numbers in later part of next week. According to analysts, the growth across segments in December could be in double-digit compared to corresponding month last year. ""Sales volumes are likely to be driven by continued positive customer sentiments spurred by better affordability (courtesy GST cuts), new products, interest rate cuts and adequate finance availability despite some pressure on rural sentiments due to a drop in retail crop prices,"" Nuvama Institutional Equities said. FII Flow The focus will also be on the Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) mood, though the activity may be low due to new year holiday week with many countries globally celebrating New Year's Day as a public holiday. FIIs were net sellers for the latest week to the tune of Rs 4,291 crore, taking their total net selling to over Rs 24,000 crore in current month, higher than Rs 17,500 crore selling in previous month. However, Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) continued to compensate the FII outflow by wide margin even in the latest week as they net bought more than Rs 12,000 crore worth shares during the week, taking the total net purchases to over Rs 64,000 crore for December, as per provisional data. Improvement in fundamentals are likely to attract net FII inflows in 2026. Robust GDP growth and prospects of improvement in corporate earnings in 2026 augur well for positive FII flows in 2026, said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist of Geojit Investments. The sustained selling by FIIs have contributed significantly to the sharp depreciation in rupee which depreciated 0.22 percent for the last week to 89.75 against the US dollar, 0.46 percent for current month, and 4.93 percent for 2025. In previous week, it touched a record low of 91.08. Meanwhile, the US dollar index remained below 100 mark for the fifth consecutive week, falling 0.67 percent for the latest week to 98.05 and trading below all key moving averages and even the midline of Bollinger bands. It was pressured by market speculation that President Trump may favour appointing a more dovish Federal Reserve Chair. This outlook, viewed as bearish for the greenback. IPO Action The activity at the IPO desk will be muted next week with only one IPO getting launched which is from the SME segment. Gurugram-based diagnostic chain Modern Diagnostic & Research Centre will open its Rs 37 crore Initial Public offering (IPO) on December 31 with price band of Rs 85-90 per share, while E to E Transportation Infrastructure, which provides system integration and engineering solutions for the railway sector, will close its Rs 84-crore public issue on January 2. Meanwhile, total 11 new companies will be available for trading on the bourses next week with Gujarat Kidney & Super Speciality from the mainboard segment listing on December 30. In the SME segment, Dachepalli Publishers, Shyam Dhani Industries, Sundrex Oil Company, and EPW India will also list on December 30, while the trading in Dhara Rail Projects, Admach Systems, Nanta Tech, Bai Kakaji Polymers, and Apollo Techno Industries shares will commence on December 31. E to E Transportation Infrastructure will also commence trading next week on January 2. Technical View Technically, the Nifty 50 has formed a Gravestone Doji–like pattern on the weekly charts, which is generally considered a bearish reversal pattern; however, the movement in the following week will be watched for confirmation. On the levels front, 26,200–26,250 is expected to be a crucial hurdle zone for the index, as sustaining above it could open the door for the 26,350–26,500 zone. However, falling decisively below the 26,000–25,950 zone could provide support to bears for a downward move toward 25,700, experts said. The momentum and technical indicators suggest a cautious outlook, with confirmation needed from upcoming price action. F&O Cues The monthly options data also indicated that the Nifty 50 may trade in the 25,900-26,300 range in the short term. The maximum Call open interest was seen at the 26,200 strike, followed by the 26,100 and 26,300 strikes, with the maximum Call writing at the 26,100, 26,050 and 26,200 strikes. On the Put side, the 26,000 strike holds the maximum Put open interest, followed by the 25,800 and 25,900 strikes, with the maximum Put writing at the 26,050, 25,950 and 25,900 strikes. Meanwhile, the India VIX, the fear index, ended at the record closing low of 9.15, down 3.91 percent for the week, giving comfort for bulls and also signalling the possibility of sharp market move.

The stock climbed as much as 14.79 percent to an intraday high of Rs 545.95, which also marked its new 52-week high. It opened the session with a gap-up of about 14.6 percent and maintained the upward momentum through the day. With this, the stock has gained more than 36 percent in the last seven trading sessions. The company's market capitalization also briefly touched the Rs 50,000 crore mark. Monday’s rally was the sharpest single-day rise in the stock since April 2010, following a surge in copper prices to record levels on the London Metal Exchange. Copper futures on the Multi Commodity Exchange of India also hit a fresh record high, tracking gains in overseas markets. Prices were supported by tight supplies, supportive US economic data, expectations of interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve and a weaker dollar. A weaker dollar typically makes dollar-denominated commodities more attractive for holders of other currencies, thereby boosting demand. The Nifty Metal index hit a fresh 52-week high today, gaining around 5 percent in eight sessions so far. ""The sharp rise in metal stocks is being supported by a favourable global macro setup rather than a single trigger,"" said Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS.

Turnover has picked up, signalling institutional interest returning after a weak November,"" he added.

241,Markets,"PNB shares fall up to 3% as PSU bank reports Rs 2,434-cr loan fraud against ex-promoters of Srei Group to RBI","December 29, 2025 / 10:48 IST","Shares of Punjab National Bank fell as much as 3.1% to Rs 116.6 apiece on December 29 as the PSU bank reported a loan fraud of Rs 2,434 crore committed by former promoters of SREI Equipment Finance Ltd (SEFL) and SREI Infrastructure Finance Ltd (SIFL) to the Reserve Bank of India. These two entities with financial debt amounting to Rs 32,700 crore went through resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and the new promoter National Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd (NARCL) acquired them in December 2023. The bank has reported a case of borrowing fraud to the RBI against the erstwhile promoters of SEFL and SIFL, amounting to Rs 1,240.94 crore and Rs 1,193.06 crore, respectively, PNB said in a regulatory filing. At 10:35 am on December 29, PNB shares were trading 0.4% lower at Rs 119.92 apiece and were on track to snap three months of gains. So far in 2025, the stock gained 17%. The bank has already made 100% provisions against the entire outstanding amount, it said. The Reserve Bank of India, in October 2021, superseded the boards of SIFL and its wholly-owned subsidiary SEFL. The Kolkata-based Kanorias previously controlled the twin companies, SIFL and SEFL, until the RBI superseded their boards over alleged mismanagement and subsequently initiated IBC proceedings. SREI began its journey in 1989 as an asset financing NBFC, with Hemant Kanoria as the key face of SIFL. PNB had reported a 14% rise in standalone net profit at Rs 4,904 crore for the September quarter of FY26 as against Rs 4,303 crore in the year-ago period.

242,Earnings,"Metal stocks rise for 8th day as global prices soar, Hind Copper, SAIL shares jump up to 15%; what lies ahead?","December 29, 2025 / 10:50 IST","The shares of metal companies surged for the eighth consecutive session on December 29, with heavyweights like Hindustan Copper, SAIL, Tata Steel and others surging up to 15 percent. Analysts have decoded the reasons behind the recent surge in the stocks, and what lies ahead. The sharp rise in the metal stocks today pushed the Nifty Metal index up 1.5 percent to 10,967.75, as seen at 9.55 am on Monday. Earlier during the day, the index hit a fresh 52-week high of 10,983.20. The index has now gained around 5 percent in eight sessions of gains so far. Why are metal stocks rising? The sharp rise in the metal stocks has been supported by a favourable global macro setup rather than a single trigger, said Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS. ""Recent sessions saw Nifty Metal and key names like Hindustan Copper, Hindalco, Vedanta and SAIL push to fresh highs, aided by broad-based buying across ferrous and non-ferrous counters. Turnover has picked up, signalling institutional interest returning after a weak November,"" the analyst said. Fed rate cut hopes: The sharp rise in metal stocks comes on the back of rising metal prices, due to expectations of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in US in 2026, said Aditya Welekar, Senior Research Analyst - Metals, Axis Securities. ""The easing labor market in the U.S. provides the Fed with the opportunity to lower rates, which bodes well for the metals market,"" he said. China's policy support: A key driver has been China, where incremental policy support for infrastructure, power grids, renewable energy and urban redevelopment is improving demand visibility for steel, copper, aluminium and zinc, Dasani added. “While the property sector remains weak, state-led capex and industrial activity have stabilised, helping metal prices find a floor,” he said. Tight supply: Tight inventories across several base metals have further limited downside risk despite uneven global growth, said Dasani. Welekar from Axis Securities also noted that the supply side for both precious metals and base metals like copper and aluminum is constrained, while demand remains strong. ""The demand for silver and base metals is largely driven by the ongoing needs of electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy, and advancements in artificial intelligence (AI),"" he added. Softer US dollar: Another important tailwind has been the softer US dollar. ""With markets pricing in a gradual easing cycle in the US, the dollar index has eased from recent highs, supporting dollar-denominated commodities. Lower real yields have also improved the relative attractiveness of metals. On the supply side, mining disruptions, higher energy costs and stricter environmental norms have constrained fresh capacity additions, particularly in refined metals, just as demand from energy transition themes such as electric vehicles, power transmission and renewable infrastructure remains steady,"" said Dasani. Rally in commodity prices: The current rally in gold, silver, and copper reflects a tightening physical supply environment rather than just paper-market enthusiasm, said Charmi Shah, Business Head at Wealth1. ""Silver and copper have been running structural deficits for years. In silver, demand from solar, electronics, and EV supply chains has consistently outpaced mine supply, while inventories across major exchanges remain thin. Copper, central to electrification and energy transition themes, continues to face underinvestment in new mines, long gestation periods, and declining ore grades. These constraints are now becoming visible in pricing,"" she said. Gold's strength, meanwhile, is being reinforced by aggressive central bank accumulation across emerging markets, particularly as countries seek diversification away from fiat currencies and sovereign debt, Shah said, adding that China’s buying interest across gold, silver, and industrial metals has further amplified the rally, especially at a time when global supply chains remain fragile. Top metal gainers today: Hindustan Copper shares jumped around 7 percent to trade at Rs 508.05 apiece.  Earlier during the day, the stock jumped around 15 percent to hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 545.95 apiece. This comes as copper prices hit new all-time high levels. Copper hit a record high of $12,960 a ton earlier in the session on benchmark three month copper on the London Metal Exchange. Steel Authority of India (SAIL) shares followed, rising over 4 percent. Tata Steel, Vedanta and Jindal Steel & Power shares rose more than 2 percent each. Hindustan Zinc shares gained nearly 2 percent, while APL Apollo Tubes and JSW Steel shares gained more than 1 percent each. Welspun Corp and Hindalco Industries shares gained nearly 1 percent each, while National Aluminium (NALCO), NMDC and Adani Enterprises shares were trading in the green with marginal gains. What lies ahead? Looking ahead, momentum in metal stocks could sustain, though volatility cannot be ruled out, said Dasani. Global steel demand is projected to grow only modestly through 2030, but ex-China consumption and infrastructure spending in emerging markets should still underpin a gradual uptrend in volumes. In India, government capex and housing demand remain key tailwinds for steel makers, the analyst added. Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director at Vibhavangal Anukulakara said that metals are still vulnerable to changes in global demand, currency fluctuations and rate expectations. Hence the rise can go on, but there will be bouts of volatility and occasional pullbacks as markets digest macro data and look for global growth drivers, according to the analyst. For the near term, the trade looks supported as long as the dollar stays soft and the Fed leans dovish, but any abrupt US data surprise or fresh concerns around China’s exports could trigger sharp corrections, Dasani noted, adding that for investors, this is a classic cyclical rally: focus on balance-sheet strength and cost-efficient producers rather than chasing every spike.

He was in Pimpri-Chinchwad on Sunday to campaign for the January 15 elections. ""For the sake of the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation elections, the 'clock' and the 'tutari' (trumpet) have united. The parivar has come together,"" he said. Pawar urged party workers to work hard and refrain from making any controversial comments during rallies. ""We are the ones who work for development. We will edge out those who tried to put this municipal corporation in debt,"" he said. Meanwhile, talks between the two parties are underway for a tie-up for the Pune Municipal Corporation polls. Earlier in the day, the Pawar family was in Baramati, where industrialist Gautam Adani inaugurated the Sharadchandra Pawar Centre of Excellence in Artificial Intelligence. Elections to 29 municipal corporations across Maharashtra, including the Pimpri-Chinchwad and Pune civic bodies, will be held on January 15, and votes will be counted the next day. The last date for filing nominations is December 30. Ajit, who split his uncle Sharad Pawar's Nationalist Congress Party and joined hands with the BJP and Eknath Shinde's Shiv Sena in 2023, had rebelled after making his misgivings clear about his uncle's staying at the helm of the party despite his advancing age. Ajit, who had taken oath as Deputy Chief Minister thrice in four years, had repeatedly slammed his uncle, a four-time Chief Minister of the state. Once he had even questioned why his uncle should continue to lead the party at his age. ""In other parties, leaders retire after an age. In BJP, leaders retire at 75, when are you going to stop?

Encora has ~9,300 employees, implying revenue per employee of ~USD74k vs. ~USD69k for Coforge, and operates at higher margins than Coforge. The vertical mix, primarily HiTech and Healthcare, is a positive, especially given Coforge’s strategic intent to scale these segments. Management has indicated that the transaction could be EPS accretive from day one. While there is limited clarity at this stage on the integration approach, past evidence is supportive: SLK Global was ~9-11% of Coforge revenue at the time of acquisition, while Cigniti was ~16%. That said, earlier acquisitions were largely client-led, whereas this transaction is more capability- and leadership-driven, making talent retention and execution discipline more critical given the larger scale of the deal. Outlook We continue to view Coforge as a structurally strong mid-tier player well-placed to benefit from vendor consolidation/cost-takeout deals and digital transformation.

Given that AJP will be involved in the registration process to get approvals across these markets, we expect it to generate healthy margins.

Demand in India across most key segments remained healthy in 3Q, both in replacement and OEM. While this momentum is likely to sustain in 4Q, the outlook for the CV segment remains uncertain. Further, exports demand remained strong in 3Q and is likely to sustain in 4Q as well. However, margins are likely to remain under pressure in India in 2H due to increased promotional spending. While demand in Europe remains muted, APTY continues to outperform the market over a low base. Additionally, APTY has commenced the restructuring of its Enschede facility, the benefits of which are likely to be reflected from 2HFY27E. Outlook We factor in APTY to post a 22% earnings CAGR over FY25- 28E over a corrected base. Valuations at 16.3x/14.3 FY27E/FY28E appear attractive, especially when compared to those of peers.

249,Earnings,Coforge shares rise even as analysts say $2.35-bn deal to buy Encora 'bold' but earnings dilutive,"December 29, 2025 / 10:23 IST","The shares of Coforge rose more than 2 percent in the morning trading hours of December 29 after the IT firm said that it will acquire US-based engineering services company Encora in a $2.35-billion all-stock transaction. The shares of the IT firm rose to Rs 1,711 apiece in the early trading hours of Monday, snapping a three-session losing streak. This comes even as brokerages remain divergent about their views on the impact of the acquisition of the AI firm. Coforge to acquire US-based AI firm Encora: In an exchange filing released in the post market hours of December 26, Coforge said that the acquisition will be executed through a share swap, under which the company will issue 93.8 million equity shares at Rs 1,815.91 apiece, implying a non-cash consideration of about Rs 17,032 crore. Encora shareholders will hold about 21.25 percent of Coforge’s post-issue equity capital. ""Coforge's acquisition of Encora will create a $2.5 billion Tech Services powerhouse with both the scale and capability across AI-led engineering, Cloud, and Data services to drive enterprise-grade AI-solutions,"" a release by the company read after it concluded its board meeting. Earlier, Moneycontrol exclusively reported that Coforge is in advanced discussions to acquire Encora, potentially marking one of the largest transactions in the digital engineering space, citing sources. Here's what brokerages say: Macquarie remained bullish on the shares of the company, double-upgrading its rating to 'Outperform' from 'Underperform' and raising its target price to Rs 2,230 apiece. This implies an upside potential of over 33 percent from the stock's previous closing price. The international brokerage believes that the acquisition of Encora will improve Coforge's service portfolio, and view this deal as a positive in the long term as it can accelerate Coforge's revenue growth, according to CNBC-TV18. Macquarie now expects longer-term sustainable revenue growth to be 15-18 percent. Elara Capital downgraded Coforge shares to ‘Reduce’ from ‘Accumulate’, and lowered its target price for the stock to Rs 1,720 per share from Rs 2,120 per share. The latest target price implies an upside potential of nearly 3 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The domestic brokerage noted that the acquisition will possibly help Coforge address its gaps in the North American market. However, valuations at EV/sales of 3.9x appear expensive considering that Encora posted only 7-10 percent organic revenue growth in the past two years, lower than Coforge’s revenue growth, it added. “Historically (in FY21-25), Coforge had reported high teen revenue CAGR on account of stable management, strong order book and specialization in select verticals of BFS, Insurance and Travel. Encora’s organic revenue growth, on the other ha nd, was lower at 7-10%. Despite lower growth, COFORGE is acquiring Encora at 3.9X EV/sales and ~21x EV/EBITDA, in line with COFORGE ’s multiples, which appears expensive. So, we cut our target multiple for COFORGE from 39x to 34x to reflect higher valuation concern. Organically also, some costs for COFORGE witnessed an uptick in recent quarters, which may strain its margins, going ahead. Thus, we cut our earnings estimates by 7–8% for FY27E and FY28E, respectively,” it said. Motilal Oswal Financial Services noted that the scale of transaction is large, therefore execution remains critical. Integration, leadership retention, margin management post-integration, and amortization will be the key monitorables. It however said that the vertical mix, primarily hi-tech and healthcare, is a positive, especially given Coforge’s strategic intent to scale these segments. “We believe Coforge’s strong executable order book and resilient client spending across verticals bode well for its organic business. This acquisition expands Coforge’s presence in the Hi-Tech and Healthcare verticals, though we have not yet incorporated Encora's numbers into our valuation. We continue to view Coforge as a structurally strong mid-tier player well-placed to benefit from vendor consolidation/cost-takeout deals and digital transformation,” the domestic brokerage said, while reiterating its ‘Buy’ call on the stock and a target price of Rs 2,500 per share, implying an upside potential of 49 percent. JM Financial said that the valuation looks rich given Encora’s 7 – 10 percent growth profile, CNBC-TV18 reported. Morgan Stanley analysts called the deal a ""bold move"", but said that the price tag appears expensive and is likely to be dilutive to earnings. Coforge's preference share issue creates an overhang once the lock-in period ends, Morgan Stanley added, forecasting a 12–13 percent decline in the stock. DAM Capital analysts said deal to be EPS dilutive, especially since price paid is higher than the firm's current valuation.

Management stated that a limited vendor-related fraud at Kerovit Global Private Limited (KGPL), a step-down wholly owned subsidiary, was identified during the rollout of a strengthened digital vendor onboarding framework and CWIP reconciliation. The fraud involved embezzlement and fund siphoning by Mr. Dilip Kumar Maliwal, CFO of Kajaria Bathware Private Limited (KBPL), a wholly owned subsidiary of KJC. Corrective actions include termination of the executive, filing of police complaints, a potential forensic review, and recognition of ~Rs 200mn as an exceptional item in FY26, with partial recovery already initiated. The company emphasized that the incident is isolated and the financial impact remains limited. Outlook We upward our FY27E earnings estimate by 1.3% and downward FY28E earnings estimate by 2.0% and roll forward it to Dec’27 with a TP of Rs 1,083 (Earlier Rs 1,288). We have considered 5.0% CAGR in tiles volume over FY25-28E with EBITDA margin of 17.0% in FY28. We expect Revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 6.8%/15.3%/20.7% over FY25-28E.

Currently, ACEM holds a 50.05% stake in ACC and 72.66% in Orient Cement. Under the merger of ACC and Orient Cement with ACEM, the company will issue: 1) 328 equity shares of FV INR2/sh for every 100 equity shares of FV INR10/sh of ACC, and the merger ratio is almost at par at today’s closing price of ACC; and 2) 33 equity shares of FV INR2/sh for every 100 equity shares of FV INR10/sh of Orient Cement, and the deal values Orient Cement at a ~9% premium to today’s closing price. There will be no cash consideration in the schemes. Earlier, the group had announced the amalgamation of Sanghi Industries and Penna Cement with the company and is awaiting regulatory approvals for the same. Upon this merger becoming effective, 12 equity shares of FV INR2 of ACEM will be issued for every 100 equity shares of FV INR10 of Sanghi Industries. ACEM will pay INR321.5/share to the eligible shareholders of Penna Cement. Outlook We believe the announcement is a positive development. We maintain our constructive view on the company, given its rising scale of operation, balanced capacity mix, and profitability improvement.

The embezzlement, spanning the last two years, reflects the company’s weak practices earlier. While the event has negative implications for the overall governance and controls, the management has handled it effectively; we do not see this event impacting valuations. Further, the fraud was detected during the exercise of strengthening the company’s IT/internal systems, including the vendor onboarding process. KJC has taken necessary action, involving termination of the CFO of the subsidiary and filing a police complaint. Internal controls have been made more stringent, with implementation of more such measures lined up, to avoid a repeat of such instances of fraud. Outlook The status on full recovery of the fund amount is unclear currently, and would be taken as an ‘exceptional loss’ in FY26.

ARTO is undergoing a structural transition from a contract manufacturer of market established molecules to a partnershipdriven, innovation-led platform, with strategic collaborations at the core of its growth strategy across agrochemicals, polymers, energy and advanced materials. The company aims to scale its quarterly EBITDA from ~Rs2.8bn to ~Rs4.5bn driven by Zone IV assets, rapid scale-up of capabilities, and deep R&D strength, cost savings initiatives and operating leverages, while consciously moderating balance-sheet risk through co-development, coinvestment, and long-term customer partnerships. The shift also reflects a move away from China-exposed commoditized chains toward differentiated chemistries, application-led solutions, and multi-year earnings visibility. ARTO’s transition toward becoming a long-term strategic manufacturing partner can emerge as a key structural strength over the long term. Outlook However, in the near term, the company is facing dumping pressure from Chinese players across its existing value chains like PDA, NCB and NT, which could result in margin pressure. We expect revenue/EBITDA/PAT to clock 12%/16%/27% CAGR over FY25–28E. We upgrade the stock to ‘Accumulate’ rating from ‘HOLD’ with TP of Rs403, valuing it at 24x Sep’27E EPS.

The acquisition adds a high-quality, cash-generative export terminal with take-orpay contracts, a long remaining lease life (~85 years) and strong growth visibility, while remaining largely balance-sheet neutral given the equityfunded structure. Strategically located along the East–West trade corridor, NQXT meaningfully enhances ADSEZ’s international portfolio and is expected to drive a higher contribution from overseas assets toward incremental growth. With EBITDA margins of ~65%+, NQXT is margin-accretive and should aid a steady improvement in international ports EBITDA margins as the overseas portfolio scales up.

Why are silver prices rising? According to the Augmont Bullion report published on December 24, the spot price of silver has increased by more than 140 per cent, setting new records. ""Silver may consolidate but remains structurally bullish, with many models projecting $65-$80+ through 2026 as tight supply and industrial demand persist,"" said Justin Khoo, Senior Market Analyst - APAC, VT Market Check out below to see the prices of 1 kilogram of 999 purity silver.

Justin Khoo predicts that in the near term, silver is vulnerable to tactical profit booking as prices have rallied sharply and are trading well above medium-term averages, which typically invites consolidation. ""Silver’s higher beta versus gold means corrections tend to be faster and deeper. However, any pullback should be viewed as corrective rather than trend-ending, especially while concerns about inflation, fiscal stress, and real-rate uncertainty remain supportive of precious metals. ""The sharp compression in the gold-silver ratio signals relative exhaustion in silver’s outperformance, not a reversal for the metals complex. Historically, such moves are followed by phases where gold stabilises, and silver corrects.

The stock has also corrected ~11% from Aug’25 on account of muted demand amid monsoon and GST rationalization limiting price hikes. Cement demand momentum has improved in H2FY26, aided by rural housing, commercial and urban housing demand. While several infrastructure projects have been announced, activities have been muted post monsoon. Capex on roads has been growing from Sep’25 as per recent GoI spending data. We expect demand to improve across regions as GoI spending on infrastructure improves over next few months. Key regions such as South and East where stable governments have been formed recently are expected to drive this growth; while demand from North, Central and West would remain stable. This would reduce the gap between non-trade and trade prices, which has increased in recent months. Trade prices have been largely stable. While weak rupee and higher pet coke prices are expected to impact industry margins, UTCEM would benefit from higher coal share, logistics optimization aided by expanded manufacturing footprint, and synergy benefits of integration of acquired capacities. Outlook We expect UTCEM volumes to clock ~12% CAGR over FY25-28E on the back of superior execution and ramp up of recent inorganic expansion. We have tweaked our estimates by -6%/-1%/+4% for FY26/27/28E on near-term weak cement pricing while maintaining volume assumptions. We expect EBITDA to deliver strong 24% CAGR over FY25-28E.

The mgmt expects credit growth to remain healthy at 11- 13%, driven by growth in the retail/MSME and corporate segments, incl its sizable overseas portfolio that is benefiting from rupee depreciation. The mgmt expects core NIM to be stable at ~2.8% and overall margins at 2.85-3% in H2, supported by interest on the IT refund continuing in the near term. BoB carries floating provision of Rs10bn (0.1% of loans) in anticipation of potential transition to the ECL framework and expects a modest impact of ~75bps on CET 1 from the draft ECL norms, which too could be slightly diluted. The mgmt stated that banks are not involved in any discussions on PSB consolidation; it is hopeful that the consolidation would be less stressful this time around, as most banks are relatively healthy now and considering learnings from the last round. Outlook We retain BUY on BoB while raising our TP to Rs350 (from Rs330), rolling forward SA bank to 1x Dec-27E ABV and subsidiaries/investment at Rs15/sh.

(MIDWESTL) is India’s largest producer and exporter of premium Black Galaxy Granite. It holds over 60% of India’s export market share and is a leading player in Absolute Black Granite. The company is vertically integrated across the granite supply chain, operating 20 mines, and has generated ~INR6.3b in revenue during FY25, with a CAGR exceeding 21% over the past five years. MIDWESTL boasts a best-in-class EBITDA margin of 27.4%, with a CAGR of more than 44% during the same period, outperforming its granite industry peers. Management has a multi-pronged growth strategy focused on leveraging the company’s leadership in Black Galaxy and Absolute Black granite while diversifying into highgrowth sectors such as quartz grit and powder and beach-sand heavy minerals. The company’s granite (core operations) volumes are projected to scale up to ~150,000 CBM by FY28 through new mine- and cluster-based expansions, ensuring steady and sustained earnings growth, with revenue and EBIT likely to clock a CAGR of ~12% each over FY25-28E. The primary opportunity lies in the quartz processing plants, which require a capex of ~INR1.3b in Phase II to reach a capacity of about 600 ktpa by FY27E vs. the current 300 ktpa. This expansion aligns seamlessly with domestic demand, which is poised to record a CAGR of ~25%. Additionally, the company is foraying into the mining (having obtained four mines in Sri Lanka) and processing of heavy mineral sands (HMS), primarily used as feedstock for Titanium Dioxide. Outlook We initiate coverage on MIDWESTL with a BUY rating. We value the company at 13x FY28E EV/EBITDA to arrive at our TP of INR2,000.

The management reiterated guidance of ~Rs30,000 EBITDA/mt and ~10% volume growth in conductors, alongside ~8% YoY growth in specialty oils in FY26. The impact of reciprocal tariffs is expected to be limited to order finalization timelines. The tariffs are unlikely to have a material financial impact.

The cables business remains a key growth engine, with the management targeting ~Rs100bn in revenue, underpinned by capacity expansion and rising demand for specialty, power and low-duty cables. Q3FY26 is expected to remain muted due to elevated raw material prices and slower order finalizations, followed by a recovery in Q4FY26.

279,Commodities,"Metal stocks rise for 8th day as global prices soar, Hind Copper, SAIL shares jump up to 15%; what lies ahead?","December 29, 2025 / 10:50 IST","The shares of metal companies surged for the eighth consecutive session on December 29, with heavyweights like Hindustan Copper, SAIL, Tata Steel and others surging up to 15 percent. Analysts have decoded the reasons behind the recent surge in the stocks, and what lies ahead. The sharp rise in the metal stocks today pushed the Nifty Metal index up 1.5 percent to 10,967.75, as seen at 9.55 am on Monday. Earlier during the day, the index hit a fresh 52-week high of 10,983.20. The index has now gained around 5 percent in eight sessions of gains so far. Why are metal stocks rising? The sharp rise in the metal stocks has been supported by a favourable global macro setup rather than a single trigger, said Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS. ""Recent sessions saw Nifty Metal and key names like Hindustan Copper, Hindalco, Vedanta and SAIL push to fresh highs, aided by broad-based buying across ferrous and non-ferrous counters. Turnover has picked up, signalling institutional interest returning after a weak November,"" the analyst said. Fed rate cut hopes: The sharp rise in metal stocks comes on the back of rising metal prices, due to expectations of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in US in 2026, said Aditya Welekar, Senior Research Analyst - Metals, Axis Securities. ""The easing labor market in the U.S. provides the Fed with the opportunity to lower rates, which bodes well for the metals market,"" he said. China's policy support: A key driver has been China, where incremental policy support for infrastructure, power grids, renewable energy and urban redevelopment is improving demand visibility for steel, copper, aluminium and zinc, Dasani added. “While the property sector remains weak, state-led capex and industrial activity have stabilised, helping metal prices find a floor,” he said. Tight supply: Tight inventories across several base metals have further limited downside risk despite uneven global growth, said Dasani. Welekar from Axis Securities also noted that the supply side for both precious metals and base metals like copper and aluminum is constrained, while demand remains strong. ""The demand for silver and base metals is largely driven by the ongoing needs of electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy, and advancements in artificial intelligence (AI),"" he added. Softer US dollar: Another important tailwind has been the softer US dollar. ""With markets pricing in a gradual easing cycle in the US, the dollar index has eased from recent highs, supporting dollar-denominated commodities. Lower real yields have also improved the relative attractiveness of metals. On the supply side, mining disruptions, higher energy costs and stricter environmental norms have constrained fresh capacity additions, particularly in refined metals, just as demand from energy transition themes such as electric vehicles, power transmission and renewable infrastructure remains steady,"" said Dasani. Rally in commodity prices: The current rally in gold, silver, and copper reflects a tightening physical supply environment rather than just paper-market enthusiasm, said Charmi Shah, Business Head at Wealth1. ""Silver and copper have been running structural deficits for years. In silver, demand from solar, electronics, and EV supply chains has consistently outpaced mine supply, while inventories across major exchanges remain thin. Copper, central to electrification and energy transition themes, continues to face underinvestment in new mines, long gestation periods, and declining ore grades. These constraints are now becoming visible in pricing,"" she said. Gold's strength, meanwhile, is being reinforced by aggressive central bank accumulation across emerging markets, particularly as countries seek diversification away from fiat currencies and sovereign debt, Shah said, adding that China’s buying interest across gold, silver, and industrial metals has further amplified the rally, especially at a time when global supply chains remain fragile. Top metal gainers today: Hindustan Copper shares jumped around 7 percent to trade at Rs 508.05 apiece.  Earlier during the day, the stock jumped around 15 percent to hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 545.95 apiece. This comes as copper prices hit new all-time high levels. Copper hit a record high of $12,960 a ton earlier in the session on benchmark three month copper on the London Metal Exchange. Steel Authority of India (SAIL) shares followed, rising over 4 percent. Tata Steel, Vedanta and Jindal Steel & Power shares rose more than 2 percent each. Hindustan Zinc shares gained nearly 2 percent, while APL Apollo Tubes and JSW Steel shares gained more than 1 percent each. Welspun Corp and Hindalco Industries shares gained nearly 1 percent each, while National Aluminium (NALCO), NMDC and Adani Enterprises shares were trading in the green with marginal gains. What lies ahead? Looking ahead, momentum in metal stocks could sustain, though volatility cannot be ruled out, said Dasani. Global steel demand is projected to grow only modestly through 2030, but ex-China consumption and infrastructure spending in emerging markets should still underpin a gradual uptrend in volumes. In India, government capex and housing demand remain key tailwinds for steel makers, the analyst added. Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director at Vibhavangal Anukulakara said that metals are still vulnerable to changes in global demand, currency fluctuations and rate expectations. Hence the rise can go on, but there will be bouts of volatility and occasional pullbacks as markets digest macro data and look for global growth drivers, according to the analyst. For the near term, the trade looks supported as long as the dollar stays soft and the Fed leans dovish, but any abrupt US data surprise or fresh concerns around China’s exports could trigger sharp corrections, Dasani noted, adding that for investors, this is a classic cyclical rally: focus on balance-sheet strength and cost-efficient producers rather than chasing every spike.

The abrupt decline in the UBS SDIC Silver Futures Fund LOF follows weeks of gains – flagged as “unsustainable” by the fund’s manager – fueled by rising global interest in precious metals. Spot silver hit a record high of $72.70 an ounce on Wednesday and is on track for its best annual performance since 1979. After the fund hit its upward limit of 10% for three straight days this week, UBS SDIC Fund Management Co. tightened the rules on Wednesday evening. New subscriptions to Class C shares – typically the preferred vehicle for short-term investments — will be limited from Dec. 26 to 100 yuan ($14.25), down from 500 yuan, the fund manager said in a statement on its website. UBS SDIC also repeated multiple earlier warnings that the fund’s high premium over the value of its underlying assets – silver contracts on the Shanghai Futures Exchange – posed a danger of steep losses should silver futures reverse. Silver has been at the center of intense investor interest in precious metals, with the spectacular rally in the global spot price gaining further momentum from a historic short squeeze in October. Gold, platinum and palladium have spiked too, and other Chinese funds linked to the metals have also seen big gains and warnings to investors. The silver fund has gained nearly 220% this year, compared with a roughly 128% increase in Shanghai-traded silver futures. By Wednesday, the premium over the underlying asset stood at nearly 62%, up from 7% at the start of this month. That level should fall on Thursday as the fund’s value sank and futures extended gains.

285,Commodities,"Gold price today: Spot, futures hit fresh record highs on aggressive central bank buying","December 23, 2025 / 10:48 IST","Gold continues its uptrend, setting new all-time highs. The gold futures price on MCX hit an all-time high at Rs 1,38,307 per 10 grams of 24-Carat purity on December 23 (9:45 am IST). The trading in futures involves standardised contracts to buy and sell the precious metal at a predetermined price. Its price is 1.14 percent up from their previous close. The gold futures price previously peaked on MCX at Rs 1,36,744 as recorded on December 22. The spot price of gold, where the physical precious metal is bought and sold for immediate delivery, continues to surge, too. Gold spot price stood just above $4,486 an ounce on Tuesday. The price is up 0.96 percent in a day and 4.28 percent in a week. Meanwhile, the rupee stood at 89.697 against the U.S. dollar on Monday, representing a 0.15 per cent gain in a day and a 1.38 per cent decline in a week. The precious metal is on track to make its largest advances since 1979, when it also set a record number of highs. Why are gold prices rising? The Augmont Bullion report, released December 23, noted that gold futures contracts reached a new high of $4,440 for the 52nd time this year, marking a 66 per cent increase. “This rise is being fueled by prolonged geopolitical tensions (Venezuela Blockade and Caribbean Naval Tension), aggressive central-bank buying, supply interruptions in Silver, and a global investing community more concerned about economic and political unpredictability,” the report stated. The Augmont report predicts that if gold continues its bullish momentum, it can touch the next target of $4,500 with strong support at $4,330. “The rally is being driven by strong expectations of a US rate cut and continued central bank buying, which is keeping bullish sentiment firmly intact. However, from a technical perspective, gold is now in an overbought zone, and a sharp bout of profit booking cannot be ruled out. “This week, US data, including new home sales, the Core PCE price index, and weekly jobless claim will remain crucial triggers for further price direction,"" said Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities.

Source: Goodreturns How to strategically add gold in portfolio? According to the Augmont report, one of the major learnings from 2025 that should be applied to 2026 is that while uncertainty can take many forms, chronic worry surrounding tariffs, geopolitics, conflict, politics, government shutdowns, legislation, and so on has left investors feeling underexposed to gold. When combined with gold's good price performance and lower correlations, we believe it is now more widely acknowledged as a strategic component of portfolios. Historically, Wall Street recommended a 60/40 strategy, with 60 percent equities and 40 percent fixed-income investments (mainly bonds). Given the changing market circumstances, most fund managers and analysts recommend that investors explore a 60/20/20 strategy, which involves swapping half of their bond portfolio for gold to act as a ""more resilient"" inflation hedge. “The 60-20-20 allocation scheme has gained popularity and attention in the financial media. If the theory achieves popular acceptance, gold may reach new highs. With most portfolios' average gold allocation under 5 percent, investors would need to buy a lot more yellow metal to increase their gold holdings to 20 percent. This reflects gold's increased standing as a basic portfolio diversifier rather than a crisis hedge of last resort,” the report, citing Renisha Chainani, Head (Research), Augmont, stated.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/gold-price-today-spot-futures-hit-fresh-record-highs-on-aggressive-central-bank-buying-13738689.html
286,Commodities,"Copper heads toward $12,000 a ton as banks predict further gains","December 22, 2025 / 15:16 IST","Copper climbed to a fresh record and approached $12,000 late in a year dominated by trade turmoil, tight supply and a bullish outlook on long-term demand. With just a few trading days left before year-end on the London Metal Exchange, copper is up almost 40% in its biggest annual gain since 2009. The metal that’s crucial for the energy transition has powered higher in recent months as growing concerns about tightening global supply have outweighed a slowdown in demand. The immediate driver is a rush of metal to the US — aimed at front-running potential import tariffs — that threatens to leave the rest of the world undersupplied. But this year’s advance has also been fueled by unplanned mine outages and the buzz around its use in the infrastructure for artificial intelligence. Investors have piled into futures and mining stocks despite widespread production setbacks. There have already been plenty of bullish forecasts for 2026. Citigroup Inc. has said prices could hit $13,000 a ton by the second quarter amid the scramble to get metal to US shores. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. last week flagged copper as its favored metal for the year ahead. In a clear sign of growing supply stress, difficult talks for annual ore supply contracts resulted in a deal for smelters to get zero dollars per ton for processing fees — the lowest on record. Some smelters have already been forced to shut down or dial back production as their processing margins have plunged, and further outages could add to strains on supply of refined metal traded on the LME and other futures exchanges. Copper was up 0.9% to $11,982 a ton by 8:14 a.m. local time on the LME.

287,Commodities,"Silver poised to overtake NVIDIA to become the second-most valued asset, says analyst","December 26, 2025 / 16:55 IST","Silver has overtaken Apple Inc and Alphabet in terms of market capitalisation, and is inching towards overtaking NVIDIA Corporation to become the world’s second-most valued asset after gold. Currently, silver sits at a market capitalisation of $4.220 trillion, as per companiesmarketcap.com, just 8.1 percent behind NVIDIA at $4.592 trillion, whereas gold commands the market capitalisation of $31.598 trillion, as of Friday (December 26, 2025). The spot price of silver on Comex surpassed the $75 an ounce on Friday and continued to surge to a record-level peak. The domestic futures price on MCX hit an all-time high at Rs 2,33,115 per 1 kilogram during the day’s trading session. The price of NVIDIA, on the other hand, stood at $188.61 (2:54 pm IST), representing a decline of 0.32 percent in the last 24 hours. “The way silver is moving, it is likely to be the second-most valuable asset, surpassing NVIDIA,” said Surendra Mehta, national secretary, India Bullion and Jewellers Association (IBJA). “With almost a $7 difference between the price of silver on Comex and Shanghai (stock exchanges), the global arbitrage system and price discovery mechanism of silver has collapsed. Normally, this difference is less than $1. The silver price may further surprise everyone, as the white metal is moving from the LBMA vault to China for better pricing,” said Mehta.  Outlook: Will silver continue its momentum? Silver prices on the Multi-Commodity Exchange of India (MCX) jumped by a whopping 153.14 percent in a year– from Rs 91,600 on December 26, 2024, to Rs 2,31,879 on December 26, 2025; whereas, gold has given a return of 79.75 percent in the same period, rising from Rs 77,460 to Rs 1,39,233 per 10 grams of 24-carat purity. The rally has been driven by a mix of global rate cuts, rising liquidity, a softer dollar and structurally strong industrial demand. Silver’s recent surge has been fueled by growing anticipation of another rate cut by the US Federal Reserve, with the next FOMC meeting scheduled for January 27-28, 2026. Traders are now betting on 84.5 percent chances of a rate cut by 350-375 basis points (bps). Another factor that has softened the safe-haven flows is the war between Israel and Iran, as well as rising tensions between the United States and Venezuela. “The acute supply tightness for metals is keeping prices sharply higher. Big bullion banks are being forced to cover their paper silver with actual physical silver, which is not available, and are also forcing them to empty their warehouse stock from Comex. “China is also ready to set export restrictions on silver from January 1, 2026. There are no sanctions, but control of the metal in other markets increases further bottlenecks in the market,” said Manav Modi, Commodities Analyst, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/silver-poised-to-overtake-nvidia-to-become-the-second-most-valued-asset-says-analyst-13743785.html
288,Commodities,Gold steadies as traders book profits after rally to record,"December 25, 2025 / 08:44 IST","Gold was little changed following a three-day rally that took the precious metal to an all-time high above $4,500 an ounce. Platinum tumbled more than 6%, also retreating from an all-time high touched overnight. Some traders are starting to take profits as the year draws to a close after a ferocious run in the precious-metals markets that still leaves gold up almost 70% in 2025. Platinum has more than doubled. Technical indicators supported the selling. Gold’s 14-day relative strength index was in overbought territory Wednesday, a warning that the price could be due for a pause or pullback. Gold’s recent run has been driven by its haven appeal amid escalating frictions in Venezuela, where the US has blockaded oil tankers. Traders are also betting the Federal Reserve will lower borrowing costs further next year, which would be a tailwind for non-yielding precious metals. Gold and silver are both are on track for their best annual performances since 1979. The rally in precious metals has been underpinned by elevated central-bank purchases and inflows into exchange-traded funds. Total holdings in gold-backed ETFs have risen every month this year except May, according to World Gold Council data. US President Donald Trump’s aggressive moves to reshape global trade — as well as his threats to the Fed’s independence — added fuel to the bull run earlier this year. Investors have also been spurred in part by the so-called debasement trade — a retreat from sovereign bonds and the currencies they are denominated in over fears their value will erode over time due to ballooning debt levels. “The dominant drivers for both gold and silver right now are the combination of sustained physical demand and renewed sensitivity to macro risk,” said John Feeney, business development manager at Guardian Vaults, a Sydney-based bullion dealer. “We’re seeing momentum reinforced rather than capped, which suggests underlying conviction rather than purely speculative froth.” Underscoring this demand, gold bounced back quickly after a retreat from its previous peak of $4,381 an ounce in October, when the rally was seen as overheated. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is among several banks to predict prices will keep rising in 2026, issuing a base-case scenario of $4,900 with risks to the upside. Heavy ETF buying has also been a major driver of the latest surge. Holdings in State Street Corp.’s SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest precious-metals ETF, have risen by more than a fifth this year. Silver traded above $70 an ounce for the first time this week. The metal’s rally has been even more spectacular than gold’s, with its most recent advance buoyed by speculative inflows and lingering supply dislocations across major trading hubs following a historic short squeeze in October. London’s vaults have seen significant inflows since then, but much of the world’s available silver remains in New York as traders await the outcome of a US Commerce Department probe on whether critical minerals imports threaten national security, which could lead to tariffs or trade restrictions on the metal. “Unlike previous silver rallies driven primarily by leverage, this move is being underwritten by real demand for metal, which is changing how the market behaves around key price thresholds,” said Feeney. “I can’t see an end to the trend just yet.” Meanwhile, platinum earlier on Wednesday traded above $2,300 an ounce for the first time since Bloomberg began compiling data in 1987. The metal has been buoyed by tight supplies and historically elevated borrowing costs. It has gained about 140% this year, the biggest annual increase, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The latest surge comes as the London market shows signs of tightening, with banks parking metal in the US — similarly to silver — to insure against the risk of tariffs. Platinum is also on course for a third annual deficit this year, due to supply disruptions in major producer South Africa. Spot gold slipped 0.1% to $4,479.42 an ounce at 3:07 p.m. in New York. Platinum was down 1.4%, while palladium tumbled 7%. Silver edged higher.

290,Commodities,Gold rises to record high on rate-cut bets and Venezuela tension,"December 22, 2025 / 12:01 IST","Gold rose to an all-time high, as escalating geopolitical tensions and bets on further US rate cuts added momentum to the best annual performance in more than four decades. Bullion climbed more than 1.5% to surpass the previous record of $4,381 an ounce set in October. Traders are betting the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates twice in 2026 after a slew of economic data last week, while US President Donald Trump has also advocated for looser monetary policy. Lower rates are typically a tailwind for precious metals, which don’t pay interest. Geopolitical tensions that have risen in recent weeks have also enhanced the haven appeal of gold and silver. The US has intensified an oil blockade against Venezuela, stepping up pressure on the government of President Nicolás Maduro, while Ukraine attacked an oil tanker from Russia’s shadow fleet in the Mediterranean Sea for the first time.  The two precious metals are both heading for their strongest annual gains since 1979. Gold has surged about two-thirds, underpinned by increased central-bank purchases and inflows into bullion-backed exchange-traded funds. Trump’s aggressive moves to reshape global trade — as well as his threats to the US central bank’s independence — added fuel to the scorching rally earlier this year. Investors have also played an important role in gold’s ascent, spurred in part by the so-called debasement trade — a retreat from sovereign bonds and the currencies they are denominated in over fears their value will erode over time due to ballooning debt levels. Gold-backed ETFs have seen inflows rise for five straight weeks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and World Gold Council figures show total holdings in these funds have risen every month this year except May. “Today’s rally is largely driven by early positioning around Fed rate-cut expectations, amplified by thin year-end liquidity,” said Dilin Wu, a strategist at Pepperstone Group Ltd. Sluggish jobs growth and softer-than-expected US inflation in November supported the narrative for more rate cuts, she said. Other precious metals also surged. Silver climbed as much as 3.4% — hitting a record just below $70 an ounce — while palladium shot up 5%. Platinum rose for an eighth straight session and traded above $2,000 for the first time since 2008. Gold has bounced back quickly after a retreat from its peak in October, when the rally was seen as overheated, and is now positioned to carry these gains into next year. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is among several banks who predict prices will keep rising in 2026, issuing a base-case scenario of $4,900 an ounce with risks to the upside. ETF investors, it said, are starting to compete with central banks for limited physical supply. Central-bank buying, physical demand and geopolitical hedging were “medium- to long-term anchors, while Fed policy and real rates continue to drive cyclical swings,” according to Pepperstone’s Wu. New entrants to the gold market, such as stablecoin issuers like Tether and certain corporate treasury departments, were creating a “broader capital base” that  “adds resilience to demand,” she said in a note.  Silver’s recent advance has been buoyed by speculative inflows and lingering supply dislocations across major trading hubs following a historic short squeeze in October. The total trading volume for silver futures in Shanghai spiked earlier this month to levels near those seen during the crunch a couple of months ago. Platinum — which has rallied around 125% this year — has risen with added speed in recent days as the London market shows signs of tightening. Banks are parking more metal in the US to insure against the risk of tariffs, while exports to China have been robust as demand grows and contracts begin trading on the Guangzhou Futures Exchange.

291,Commodities,Coforge shares rise even as analysts say $2.35-bn deal to buy Encora 'bold' but earnings dilutive,"December 29, 2025 / 10:23 IST","The shares of Coforge rose more than 2 percent in the morning trading hours of December 29 after the IT firm said that it will acquire US-based engineering services company Encora in a $2.35-billion all-stock transaction. The shares of the IT firm rose to Rs 1,711 apiece in the early trading hours of Monday, snapping a three-session losing streak. This comes even as brokerages remain divergent about their views on the impact of the acquisition of the AI firm. Coforge to acquire US-based AI firm Encora: In an exchange filing released in the post market hours of December 26, Coforge said that the acquisition will be executed through a share swap, under which the company will issue 93.8 million equity shares at Rs 1,815.91 apiece, implying a non-cash consideration of about Rs 17,032 crore. Encora shareholders will hold about 21.25 percent of Coforge’s post-issue equity capital. ""Coforge's acquisition of Encora will create a $2.5 billion Tech Services powerhouse with both the scale and capability across AI-led engineering, Cloud, and Data services to drive enterprise-grade AI-solutions,"" a release by the company read after it concluded its board meeting. Earlier, Moneycontrol exclusively reported that Coforge is in advanced discussions to acquire Encora, potentially marking one of the largest transactions in the digital engineering space, citing sources. Here's what brokerages say: Macquarie remained bullish on the shares of the company, double-upgrading its rating to 'Outperform' from 'Underperform' and raising its target price to Rs 2,230 apiece. This implies an upside potential of over 33 percent from the stock's previous closing price. The international brokerage believes that the acquisition of Encora will improve Coforge's service portfolio, and view this deal as a positive in the long term as it can accelerate Coforge's revenue growth, according to CNBC-TV18. Macquarie now expects longer-term sustainable revenue growth to be 15-18 percent. Elara Capital downgraded Coforge shares to ‘Reduce’ from ‘Accumulate’, and lowered its target price for the stock to Rs 1,720 per share from Rs 2,120 per share. The latest target price implies an upside potential of nearly 3 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The domestic brokerage noted that the acquisition will possibly help Coforge address its gaps in the North American market. However, valuations at EV/sales of 3.9x appear expensive considering that Encora posted only 7-10 percent organic revenue growth in the past two years, lower than Coforge’s revenue growth, it added. “Historically (in FY21-25), Coforge had reported high teen revenue CAGR on account of stable management, strong order book and specialization in select verticals of BFS, Insurance and Travel. Encora’s organic revenue growth, on the other ha nd, was lower at 7-10%. Despite lower growth, COFORGE is acquiring Encora at 3.9X EV/sales and ~21x EV/EBITDA, in line with COFORGE ’s multiples, which appears expensive. So, we cut our target multiple for COFORGE from 39x to 34x to reflect higher valuation concern. Organically also, some costs for COFORGE witnessed an uptick in recent quarters, which may strain its margins, going ahead. Thus, we cut our earnings estimates by 7–8% for FY27E and FY28E, respectively,” it said. Motilal Oswal Financial Services noted that the scale of transaction is large, therefore execution remains critical. Integration, leadership retention, margin management post-integration, and amortization will be the key monitorables. It however said that the vertical mix, primarily hi-tech and healthcare, is a positive, especially given Coforge’s strategic intent to scale these segments. “We believe Coforge’s strong executable order book and resilient client spending across verticals bode well for its organic business. This acquisition expands Coforge’s presence in the Hi-Tech and Healthcare verticals, though we have not yet incorporated Encora's numbers into our valuation. We continue to view Coforge as a structurally strong mid-tier player well-placed to benefit from vendor consolidation/cost-takeout deals and digital transformation,” the domestic brokerage said, while reiterating its ‘Buy’ call on the stock and a target price of Rs 2,500 per share, implying an upside potential of 49 percent. JM Financial said that the valuation looks rich given Encora’s 7 – 10 percent growth profile, CNBC-TV18 reported. Morgan Stanley analysts called the deal a ""bold move"", but said that the price tag appears expensive and is likely to be dilutive to earnings. Coforge's preference share issue creates an overhang once the lock-in period ends, Morgan Stanley added, forecasting a 12–13 percent decline in the stock. DAM Capital analysts said deal to be EPS dilutive, especially since price paid is higher than the firm's current valuation.

Spot gold advanced to nearly $4,365 an ounce – within $20 of an all-time high – having risen for the last two weeks. Traders are betting the Fed will cut interest rates twice in 2026 after a slew of economic data last week did little to provide more clarity on the outlook, though US President Donald Trump has advocated for aggressively lowering rates. Looser monetary policy is a tailwind for gold and silver, which don’t pay interest.  Geopolitical tensions have also enhanced the haven appeal of precious metals. The US has intensified an oil blockade against Venezuela, stepping up pressure on the government of President Nicolás Maduro, while Ukraine attacked an oil tanker from Russia’s shadow fleet in the Mediterranean Sea for the first time. Precious metals are capping a historic year, with gold and silver both heading for their strongest annual gains since 1979. Silver has more than doubled and gold has surged about two-thirds, underpinned by increased central-bank buying and inflows into bullion-backed exchange-traded funds. Gold-backed ETFs have seen rising inflows for five straight weeks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and World Gold Council figures show total holdings in these funds have risen every month this year except May. Meanwhile, silver has been bolstered in recent weeks by surging demand, as well as tightness and dislocations across major trading hubs. Gold is expected to rally further next year, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts including Daan Struyven and Samantha Dart said in a note late last week, setting a base case scenario of $4,900 an ounce with risks to the upside. ETF investors, they said, are starting to compete with central banks for limited bullion. Silver advanced 0.5% to $67.46 as of 8:27 a.m. in Singapore. Spot gold rose 0.5% to $4,363.21 an ounce, within sight of the record high above $4,381 in October. Platinum climbed, after jumping 2.5% on Friday, and palladium rose 1.5%.

294,Commodities,"Silver price today: Rates smash records, up 131% in 2025; check prices in your city","December 23, 2025 / 11:29 IST","Silver continues to set record highs, fueled by industrial demand. The domestic futures price of silver on MCX peaked at Rs 2,15,883 per one kilogram of 999 purity on December 23 (10:24 am IST), representing a 1.42 percent surge from its previous close of Rs 2,12,872. The white metal’s previous peak performance on MCX was recorded at Rs 2,14,583 on December 22. The spot price of silver also surged just above $69 an ounce on Tuesday, up 0.73 percent in a day and up 9.09 percent in a week. Why are silver prices rising? According to the Augmont Bullion report published on December 22, silver's futures contract has increased 131 percent this year, reaching $69.5, breaking 15 records in the process. “Mining disruptions and limited current silver inventories are causing severe supply shortfalls, driving prices higher. Potential interest rate reduction in the United States and a lower dollar are expected to continue to boost speculator demand for silver, not to mention any geopolitical tensions that would generate keener safe-haven demand for silver,” the report stated. The Augmont report predicts that if silver continues its bullish momentum, the next target is $70 (Rs 2,16,000) and $72 (Rs 2,22,000). Strong support lies at 64.50 (~Rs 200,000).

However, silver is in the midst of a mature bull market run, and it is quite likely that the market will need to pause in the next few months. Raw commodities, especially metals, are highly cyclical and have distinct phases of boom and crisis. “There is no doubt that silver is now in a boom cycle. That suggests the following phase will be a bust cycle. The only uncertainty is the start date of the bust.

The metal rose for a 10th straight session — its longest winning streak since 2017 — and has advanced more than 150% this year, the biggest annual gain since Bloomberg began compiling data in 1987. The recent surge has come as the London market shows signs of tightening, with banks parking metal in the US to insure against the risk of tariffs. Used in the automotive and jewelry sectors, platinum has been caught up in the wave of investment that poured into precious metals this year. Gold and silver have also risen to records.  More than 600,000 ounces of platinum are sitting in US warehouses — an amount much higher than usual — as traders await the outcome of Washington’s Section 232 probe, which could lead to tariffs or trade restrictions on the metal. Meanwhile, shipments to China have been robust this year, and demand optimism has been bolstered as contracts recently began trading on the Guangzhou Futures Exchange. Prices in Guangzhou have risen well above other international benchmarks. Platinum is on course for a third annual deficit this year, due to supply disruptions in major producer South Africa. High borrowing costs have also been an issue for manufacturers that use the metal to produce goods ranging from chemicals to glass to laboratory equipment. Industrial users often choose the less capital-intensive option of leasing, rather than buying the commodity outright. Platinum rose as much as 3.1% to a record $2,361.23 as of 8:19 a.m. in Singapore.

Though trading activity will remain subdued next week, with only a few key economic releases lined up, including November's pending home sales and meeting minutes from December's Federal Open Market Committee on Tuesday, which will steer bullion prices. Gold and silver prices are likely to maintain their upward momentum in 2026, driven by prospects of global rate cuts, safe-haven appeal and firm industrial demand, however, traders may turn cautious as the pace of gains may moderate after an exceptional 2025, they added. On the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), gold futures gained by Rs 5,677, or 4.23 per cent, during the week to touch an lifetime high of Rs 1,40,465 per 10 grams on Friday. ""On the technical front, after a staggering rally of 2025, we don't expect similar returns in 2026. But the current moment may push up prices towards USD 5,000-5,200 and Rs 1,50,000-1,55,000 on the MCX in 2026,"" Pranav Mer, Vice President, EBG, Commodity & Currency Research, JM Financial Services Ltd, said. He added that underlying factors for the rally such as monetary policy easing, de-dollarisation, and global trade tensions will continue to dominate in 2026. ""Bank of Japan's rate hikes, escalation in the global trade war as more countries may join in with import restrictions by levying tariffs and economic activity in the US and China will be closely tracked,"" Mer said. In the international markets, gold prices climbed by USD 165.4, or 3.77 per cent, during the past week. It had touched a lifetime high of USD 4,584 per ounce on the Comex, ending the holiday-shortened week with strong gains. Mer noted that central bank purchases of gold have slowed as compared to the previous three years, however, buying remains steady, buoyed by portfolio diverification and currency concerns with expectation of more rate cuts. Prathamesh Mallya, DVP - Research, Non-Agri Commodities and Currencies, Angel One, said easing interest rates by the US Federal Reserve and anticipation of further rate cuts have made gold and silver more attractive in 2025. ""These assets also benefitted from safe-haven flows on account of the uncertainty created by US President Donald Trump's tariff policies, and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war,"" he added. Mallya expects gold prices to move higher towards Rs 1,60,000 per 10 grams on the commodities bourse in the first half of 2026. Silver futures, too, witnessed a spectacular week, reflecting industrial and investment demand. On the MCX, the white metal soared Rs 31,348, or 15.04 per cent, in a holiday-shortened week. It had zoomed Rs 18,210, or 8.14 per cent, to a new record of Rs 2,42,000 per kg on Friday. On the Comex, silver prices gained USD 9.71, or 14.4 per cent in the past week, touching a lifetime high of USD 79.70 per ounce in overseas trade. ""Silver is supported by strong industrial demand from new-age sectors, relatively cheap pricing compared to gold, and a sharp rally in the industrial metals after Trump's tariff announcement in April 2025,"" Pranav Mer of JM Financial Services, said. Analysts said silver prices may move higher towards Rs 2,75,000 per kilogram on the MCX and USD 80-85 per ounce globally, due to global supplies constraints. China is the world's largest consumer of silver and a leading producer of solar panels, electronics and EVs, has announced export restrictions from January 1, 2026, requiring companies to obtain licences, a move expected to remain in place through 2027, and disrupt global supply chains.

302,Commodities,"US GDP, jobs data to hold commodity traders' focus in Christmas week","December 21, 2025 / 06:48 IST","Global markets closed the week on a broadly positive note, supported by lighter-than-expected US inflation data that improved the outlook for lower interest rates in 2026 and recovery in AI-related stocks. The US dollar staged a modest recovery, gaining around 1 percent from more than two-month lows below 98 and ending the week up 0.3 percent at 98.7. However, the rebound was driven more by pronounced weakness in the Japanese yen than renewed confidence in US growth. The yen came under pressure after the Bank of Japan raised its policy rate to 0.75 percent, the highest level in three decades, amid rising inflation. Rather than supporting the currency, the move unsettled markets and triggered renewed yen selling, indirectly lending support to the dollar. Elsewhere, the European Central Bank left rates unchanged for a fourth consecutive meeting, while the Bank of England cut its policy rate by 25 basis points to 3.75 percent, citing easing inflation and mounting economic headwinds. US equities were supported by strong gains in Oracle and Nvidia, easing concerns around the AI sector. Markets also benefited from softer-than-expected US inflation data, with November headline CPI undershooting forecasts and core inflation slowing to its weakest pace since early 2021. The US unemployment rate rose to 4.6 percent, its highest level since 2021, reinforcing expectations for rate cuts later in 2026, even as near-term policy is likely to remain on hold. This also helped precious metals extend their rally. COMEX gold surged to fresh all-time highs above $4,400 per ounce before settling near $4,387, while COMEX silver jumped nearly 9 percent to a record $67.7 per ounce on strong inflows, tight supply, and robust industrial demand. Additional upside risks emerged after China announced new silver export licensing requirements from 2026–27. Gold & Silver Rates Yesterday Sunday, 28th December, 2025 Gold Rate in Mumbai Yesterday Sunday, 28th December, 2025 Silver Rate in Mumbai Yesterday On the weekly chart, MCX Silver futures witnessed an all-time high closing with weekly gains of more than 8 percent. The fourth consecutive weekly gains confirm the extreme bullishness in the counter. On the daily chart, price has been continuously holding above the 20 EMA and other medium term averages, suggesting that the short-term bullish bias remains intact. As long as the price stays above the immediate support of Rs 2,00,000 per kg, it could move higher in the coming week toward the initial resistance at Rs 2,25,000. A breakout and sustained trade above this level could accelerate the momentum towards Rs 2,40,000. However, a break below Rs 2,00,000 could pause the current momentum and send the counter in a sideways bias. Base metals on the LME ended the week on a mixed note, with copper outperforming while zinc lagged. Copper rose more than 3 percent to close above $11,880 per tonne, holding near multi-month highs despite bouts of volatility. Zinc eased to around $3,072 per tonne. The broader tone was supported by the softer US inflation backdrop, which reinforced confidence that the Federal Reserve’s easing cycle still has room to run following its third consecutive rate cut. Although policymakers remain cautious on the pace of further easing, markets are increasingly pricing in additional rate reductions into 2026, providing a medium-term tailwind for industrial metals. Copper remained firm amid ongoing supply disruptions in Chile and Peru, low visible LME inventories, and continued metal flows into the US ahead of potential tariff measures, which have tightened availability elsewhere. Meanwhile, WTI crude oil fell to $54.98 per barrel, its lowest level since 2021, pressured by oversupply concerns and optimism surrounding progress toward a potential Ukraine peace deal after Trump stated that an agreement to end the war was closer than ever following talks with Ukraine’s President Zelenskiy and European leaders. Prices later attempted a rebound toward $57 per barrel, supported by escalating geopolitical tensions following reports that the US is preparing a fresh round of sanctions on Russia’s energy sector. Trump also ordered a “total and complete” blockade of all sanctioned oil tankers entering or leaving the country, adding further support to prices. With the upcoming holiday week likely to see thinner trading volumes, price action may be subdued. Only a handful of economic releases are scheduled during Christmas week, notably US GDP, ADP employment data, and weekly jobless claims, as investors assess the health of the US economy and look for further clues on the timing of the next Federal Reserve interest-rate cut.

305,Commodities,"Gold, silver's historic rally could extend on potential dovish Fed signal","December 28, 2025 / 06:11 IST","Market sentiment remained largely cheerful during the Christmas week, with equities touching record highs and both industrial and precious metals posting extraordinary gains. Copper and silver surged to fresh all-time highs, capping an unprecedented rally and closing the week with double-digit gains. The US dollar edged lower and hovered near the 98 level, pressured by market speculation that President Trump may favour appointing a more dovish Federal Reserve Chair. This outlook, viewed as bearish for the greenback, combined with expectations of a traditional Santa Claus rally, helped push all three major US equity indices toward record highs. However, the standout performers were undoubtedly metals. Gold and silver surged to new all-time highs, extending a historic year-end rally and heading for their best year since 1979, driven by escalating geopolitical risks, a weaker US dollar, and expectations of easier monetary policy ahead. On COMEX, gold and silver posted sharp weekly gains of around 3.8% and over 14%, respectively. Gold futures climbed to a record high of $4,581.30 per ounce, while silver futures surged to nearly $79.70 per ounce, marking the largest one-week dollar gain on record for silver. Silver’s parabolic rise has been reinforced by speculative inflows and lingering supply dislocations across key trading hubs following October’s historic short squeeze. SHFE backwardation and expectations of potential export curbs from 2026 have further strengthened the structural bullish outlook. MCX Gold futures recorded its highest-ever weekly close at Rs 1,39,940 per 10 grams last week, marking the seventh consecutive positive weekly close. Prices continue to trade above the Supertrend (7,3), indicating that the short-term bullish trend remains intact. We expect the bullish momentum to extend into the coming week; however, prices may face initial resistance around Rs 1,42,000, followed by Rs 1,44,000. On the downside, immediate support is seen at Rs 1,36,400, with the next support placed near Rs 1,32,900. Gold & Silver Rates Yesterday Sunday, 28th December, 2025 Gold Rate in Mumbai Yesterday Sunday, 28th December, 2025 Silver Rate in Mumbai Yesterday Copper mirrored this strength, posting double-digit gains on the MCX and finishing nearly 13% higher at a record Rs 1,260 per kg. Globally, LME copper prices broke above $12,200 per tonne, while COMEX futures climbed toward $5.90 per pound. Copper also set fresh records on the Shanghai exchange, supported by expectations of a tighter global market heading into 2026 amid mine disruptions and pre-emptive stockpiling in COMEX warehouses ahead of a potential policy review. Additionally, Chinese regulators have signaled tighter oversight of new copper and alumina projects from 2026, reinforcing expectations of sustained supply discipline. Aluminium and zinc also ended the week higher, gaining around 5% and 3%, respectively. Meanwhile, WTI crude oil surged above $58 per barrel and was initially set for weekly gains as geopolitical tensions raised concerns over potential supply disruptions. Risks intensified following the US interception of a Panama-flagged supertanker linked to Venezuela, with several loaded vessels currently waiting offshore after Trump announced a blockade on all vessels traveling to and from the country. Traders also assessed the impact of a US military strike against a militant group in Nigeria. However, oil prices fell more than 2% on Friday, erasing earlier gains, as caution set in ahead of a scheduled meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday (December 28) to discuss a proposed 20-point framework aimed at ending the Russia–Ukraine war. Looking ahead, thin holiday trading is likely to exaggerate short-term market moves as investors navigate a relatively light economic calendar. Attention will be on the FOMC meeting minutes and weekly US jobless claims, while markets also await President Trump’s expected pick for the next Fed Chair, a decision that could shape the monetary policy outlook. As 2025 draws to a close, the broader outlook for commodities appears firmly constructive. Structural supply constraints, tariff-driven trade distortions, and sustained demand from AI infrastructure and renewable energy technologies have combined to reset expectations, particularly for copper and silver. Gold, meanwhile, continues to stand out as a hedge, underpinned by geopolitical risks, trade frictions, and expectations of further interest rate cuts in the year ahead.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/commodities/gold-silver-s-historic-rally-could-extend-on-potential-dovish-fed-signal-13745198.html

307,Commodities,Gold and silver smash records again as rally gathers momentum,"December 26, 2025 / 16:37 IST","Gold, silver and platinum jumped to all-time highs to extend a historic end-of-year rally for precious metals, with support from escalating geopolitical tensions and US dollar weakness. Spot gold rose as much as 1.2% to a peak above $4,530 an ounce. Frictions in Venezuela, where the US has blockaded oil tankers and ramped up pressure on the government of Nicolás Maduro, have added to the precious metal’s haven appeal. Washington also launched a military strike against Islamic State in Nigeria in collaboration with the African nation’s government. Spot silver for immediate delivery advanced for a fifth session, climbing as much as 4.6% to cross $75 an ounce. The white metal’s recent advance has been buoyed by speculative inflows and lingering supply dislocations across major trading hubs following a historic short squeeze in October. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, a key gauge of the US currency’s strength, was down 0.7% for the week, its biggest drop since June. A weaker dollar is generally supportive of gold and silver. Gold has gained around 70% this year and silver more than 150%, with both metals on track for their best annual performances since 1979. The scorching rally has been supported by elevated central-bank purchases, inflows to exchange-traded funds and three successive interest-rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve. Lower borrowing costs are a tailwind for precious metals, which don’t pay interest, and traders are betting on more rate cuts in 2026. US President Donald Trump’s aggressive moves to remake global trade, along with threats to the Fed’s independence, added momentum to the rally earlier this year. Investor demand has also been underpinned by the so-called debasement trade, as concerns over swelling debt loads drive a retreat from sovereign bonds and the currencies they are issued in. Gold’s resilience was demonstrated by its quick recovery after retreating from a previous peak of $4,381 in October, when the rally was seen as overheated. Heavy ETF buying has been a major driver of the latest surge, with holdings in State Street Corp.’s SPDR Gold Trust — the biggest precious-metals ETF — rising by more than a fifth this year. Silver’s rally has been even more spectacular than gold’s. Vaults in London have drawn sizable inflows since the October squeeze, though much of the world’s readily available silver remains in New York as traders await the outcome of a US Commerce Department probe into whether imports of critical minerals pose a national security risk. The review could pave the way for tariffs or other trade curbs on the metal. “You have a lot of trades or positions on paper: now you need to cover those with physical volume — and there’s not much supply to cover that demand,” said Manav Modi, commodity analyst at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. “You need to power the paper silver with the actual silver,” he said. Partly for the same reason, platinum has been on a tear in recent weeks — this month alone, it has risen by more than 40%. The metal traded above $2,400 an ounce for the first time since Bloomberg began compiling data in 1987. In addition to strong physical demand, global supply of the metal used in the automotive and jewelry sectors is on course for a third annual deficit this year, due largely to disruptions in major producer South Africa. Gold rose 0.8% to $4,516.50 as of 4:20 p.m. in Singapore. Silver climbed 4% to $74.71. Platinum advanced 4.6% to $2,361.54 and palladium was up 4.5%.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/commodities/gold-and-silver-smash-records-again-as-rally-gathers-momentum-13744125.html
308,Commodities,"Millennials, Gen Z drive 50% surge as Indians buy 12 tonnes of digital gold worth Rs 16,670 crore despite Sebi caution","December 26, 2025 / 07:42 IST","India has witnessed a sharp rise in digital gold investments this year, with purchases climbing nearly 50% despite regulatory caution from the market watchdog. Data cited by The Economic Times, based on estimates from the World Gold Council (WGC), shows Indian investors-led largely by younger buyers-purchased around 12 tonnes of digital gold between January and November. The estimate draws on transaction data released for the first time by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), which tracks UPI-based digital gold purchases. At current Mumbai spot prices, this volume of 24-karat gold is valued at approximately Rs 16,670 crore. Industry estimates suggest that digital gold purchases stood at about 8 tonnes in 2024, underscoring the pace of growth this year. Digital gold allows consumers to buy, sell and hold gold online without taking physical delivery, with investments starting from as little as Rs 1. This low entry barrier has made the product particularly popular among first-time investors, millennials and Gen Z users accessing gold through fintech platforms and mobile apps. However, demand slowed after the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) issued an advisory in November cautioning investors that digital gold is not a regulated security and does not fall under existing commodity market regulations, unlike gold exchange-traded funds or electronic gold receipts. Sebi urged investors to carefully assess the risks before using such platforms. Despite the regulatory warning, industry participants argue that digital gold is emerging as a transparent and efficient investment avenue. Sachin Jain, regional chief executive for India at the WGC, told The Economic Times that gold continues to be a core asset for Indian households, and digital formats improve accessibility through fractional ownership, market-linked pricing, and reduced concerns over storage and purity. He added that digitalisation would be key to keeping gold relevant for Indian consumers. Leading players in the digital gold space include MMTC PAMP, Augmont and SafeGold, which store physical gold in secure vaults on behalf of customers. Investors can liquidate their holdings at any time through the platforms, providing ease of exit and liquidity. The absence of formal regulation has prompted the India Bullion & Jewellers Association (IBJA) to initiate a self-regulatory organisation (SRO) for digital gold providers. The SRO is expected to begin onboarding members in January and will focus on periodic audits, ensuring full physical backing of digital holdings, and enforcing minimum net worth requirements for participating firms. IBJA national secretary Surendra Mehta said the association is developing technology to onboard and oversee digital gold platforms, with regular audits aimed at building investor confidence. The framework is expected to be finalised by the end of March or early April next year, he told The Economic Times. Industry executives noted that millennials and Gen Z account for nearly two-thirds of digital gold buyers, highlighting a broader shift toward digital-first investing. However, the Sebi advisory caused significant confusion in the market. A senior executive at a digital gold platform said purchases nearly stalled after the warning, forcing companies to actively reassure customers and bring them back to digital channels.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/commodities/millennials-gen-z-drive-50-surge-as-indians-buy-12-tonnes-of-digital-gold-worth-rs-16-670-crore-despite-sebi-caution-13742675.html

311,Commodities,Gold at the crossroads: Is there more steam left in the yellow metal?,"December 21, 2025 / 06:43 IST","Precious metals have been enjoying a strong bull run in recent months, with gold and silver emerging as standout performers. Silver, in particular, has captured market attention by touching an all-time high of around Rs 2,00,000 per kg. Against this backdrop, a natural question arises among market participants: Does the rally in gold still have substance, or has most of the upside already been priced in? To answer this, it is important to step back and evaluate gold through both fundamental and technical lenses, rather than focusing only on short-term price movements. Changing Global Order and Its Implications for Gold One of the most significant geopolitical developments impacting gold sentiment is the recent move by European Union member states to indefinitely immobilize Russian central bank assets held in Europe, amounting to nearly €210 billion. These assets will remain frozen until Russia ends the war in Ukraine and provides reparations. Gold & Silver Rates Yesterday Sunday, 28th December, 2025 Gold Rate in Mumbai Yesterday Sunday, 28th December, 2025 Silver Rate in Mumbai Yesterday While this action is conditional and theoretically reversible, the precedent it sets is far more important than the immediate financial impact. For the first time in modern history, assets belonging to a sovereign central bank, which were traditionally considered risk- free have been exposed to geopolitical and policy risk. What does this mean for gold? This episode sends a clear message to central banks and sovereign entities worldwide: even foreign exchange reserves are not entirely risk-free if they are held outside domestic control. This realization fundamentally alters the perception of “safe assets.” Gold stands out uniquely in this context. Unlike paper assets or foreign-held reserves, gold: * Is not a liability of another country * Cannot be frozen by foreign authorities when held domestically * Carries no counterparty risk As a result, such geopolitical developments are likely to accelerate central bank diversification into gold, a trend that has already been visible over the past few years. Increased central bank demand tightens effective supply in the market, which, over time, acts as a strong structural support for gold prices. Governments’ Rising Interest Expense and Its Implications on Gold: Governments across the world are now paying much higher interest on their borrowings than they did in the past. This is the result of years of heavy debt accumulation combined with a period of higher interest rates. As interest payments rise, a larger portion of government income is used to service debt, leaving less room for development spending and economic support. Over time, this creates pressure on government finances and weakens confidence in paper currencies. In such a situation, gold becomes more relevant. Gold is not linked to any government’s balance sheet and does not carry the risk of default or policy mismanagement. When debt pressures rise, governments and central banks often prefer easier monetary conditions to keep interest costs manageable. This reduces real returns on financial assets, which supports gold prices. From a long-term perspective, rising government interest burdens strengthen gold’s role as a reliable store of value and a hedge against fiscal and monetary uncertainty. The below chart perfectly shows the correlation between the rising interest cost and gold prices over the years.  Technical Setup: Is Gold Poised to Catch Up with Silver? Beyond fundamentals, technical indicators also provide valuable insight into gold’s near-term potential.  One such metric is the Gold–Silver Ratio, which measures how many units of silver are required to buy one unit of gold. Historically: A rising ratio indicates gold outperforming silver A falling ratio indicates silver outperforming gold With silver’s sharp rally, the gold–silver ratio has now declined to levels last seen in 2021, hovering near a long-term historical support zone. In the past, such levels have often marked turning points, where gold begins to outperform or catch up with silver. Given that silver has already seen a sharp and extended rally, the current ratio suggests that gold may be relatively undervalued on a comparative basis, especially when viewed alongside supportive macro and geopolitical fundamentals. Conclusion: Does Gold Have More Momentum Left? In my view, gold continues to exhibit strong underlying strength, even after its recent run-up. The convergence of: • Geopolitical uncertainty and reserve-risk awareness • Expectations of monetary easing • Supportive long-term technical structures These factors suggest that gold still retains meaningful momentum potential, particularly as a strategic hedge rather than a short-term trade. While silver has taken the spotlight recently, the broader setup indicates that gold may be preparing for a catch-up phase, supported by both fundamentals and technical indicators. For investors seeking stability, diversification, and protection against macro uncertainty, gold continues to remain a relevant and resilient asset in the current market environment.

The metal slipped as much as 8% from its peak after an aggressive rally earlier in the session. March silver futures surged to an intraday high of $82.67 an ounce in early trade, marking a further 7% rise on top of an 11% jump on Friday, which was the strongest single-day gain since 2008, CNBC-TV18 noted. At those levels, prices were extending a rally that has eclipsed even the historic short squeeze seen in October. However, the sharp moves are being amplified by thin trading conditions during the holiday period, CNBC-TV18 said. Market volumes remain subdued, which has exaggerated price swings on both sides. At their peak, silver prices are up about 180% so far in 2025, with three trading sessions still remaining in the year, putting the metal on track for its best annual performance since 1979, when gains exceeded 200%, as highlighted by CNBC-TV18. The rally is being driven by a combination of speculative inflows, supply deficits and strong industrial demand. Analysts told CNBC-TV18 that paper trading positions are increasingly being backed by physical demand, while available supply remains insufficient to meet that requirement. Tight supply conditions are also supporting platinum prices. CNBC-TV18 reported that platinum has risen more than 40% in December alone, with January futures crossing the $2,500-an-ounce mark in early trade - the highest level since records began in 1987. Gold, by contrast, has seen relatively muted price action.

314,Fintech,"Metal stocks rise for 8th day as global prices soar, Hind Copper, SAIL shares jump up to 15%; what lies ahead?","December 29, 2025 / 10:50 IST","The shares of metal companies surged for the eighth consecutive session on December 29, with heavyweights like Hindustan Copper, SAIL, Tata Steel and others surging up to 15 percent. Analysts have decoded the reasons behind the recent surge in the stocks, and what lies ahead. The sharp rise in the metal stocks today pushed the Nifty Metal index up 1.5 percent to 10,967.75, as seen at 9.55 am on Monday. Earlier during the day, the index hit a fresh 52-week high of 10,983.20. The index has now gained around 5 percent in eight sessions of gains so far. Why are metal stocks rising? The sharp rise in the metal stocks has been supported by a favourable global macro setup rather than a single trigger, said Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS. ""Recent sessions saw Nifty Metal and key names like Hindustan Copper, Hindalco, Vedanta and SAIL push to fresh highs, aided by broad-based buying across ferrous and non-ferrous counters. Turnover has picked up, signalling institutional interest returning after a weak November,"" the analyst said. Fed rate cut hopes: The sharp rise in metal stocks comes on the back of rising metal prices, due to expectations of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in US in 2026, said Aditya Welekar, Senior Research Analyst - Metals, Axis Securities. ""The easing labor market in the U.S. provides the Fed with the opportunity to lower rates, which bodes well for the metals market,"" he said. China's policy support: A key driver has been China, where incremental policy support for infrastructure, power grids, renewable energy and urban redevelopment is improving demand visibility for steel, copper, aluminium and zinc, Dasani added. “While the property sector remains weak, state-led capex and industrial activity have stabilised, helping metal prices find a floor,” he said. Tight supply: Tight inventories across several base metals have further limited downside risk despite uneven global growth, said Dasani. Welekar from Axis Securities also noted that the supply side for both precious metals and base metals like copper and aluminum is constrained, while demand remains strong. ""The demand for silver and base metals is largely driven by the ongoing needs of electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy, and advancements in artificial intelligence (AI),"" he added. Softer US dollar: Another important tailwind has been the softer US dollar. ""With markets pricing in a gradual easing cycle in the US, the dollar index has eased from recent highs, supporting dollar-denominated commodities. Lower real yields have also improved the relative attractiveness of metals. On the supply side, mining disruptions, higher energy costs and stricter environmental norms have constrained fresh capacity additions, particularly in refined metals, just as demand from energy transition themes such as electric vehicles, power transmission and renewable infrastructure remains steady,"" said Dasani. Rally in commodity prices: The current rally in gold, silver, and copper reflects a tightening physical supply environment rather than just paper-market enthusiasm, said Charmi Shah, Business Head at Wealth1. ""Silver and copper have been running structural deficits for years. In silver, demand from solar, electronics, and EV supply chains has consistently outpaced mine supply, while inventories across major exchanges remain thin. Copper, central to electrification and energy transition themes, continues to face underinvestment in new mines, long gestation periods, and declining ore grades. These constraints are now becoming visible in pricing,"" she said. Gold's strength, meanwhile, is being reinforced by aggressive central bank accumulation across emerging markets, particularly as countries seek diversification away from fiat currencies and sovereign debt, Shah said, adding that China’s buying interest across gold, silver, and industrial metals has further amplified the rally, especially at a time when global supply chains remain fragile. Top metal gainers today: Hindustan Copper shares jumped around 7 percent to trade at Rs 508.05 apiece.  Earlier during the day, the stock jumped around 15 percent to hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 545.95 apiece. This comes as copper prices hit new all-time high levels. Copper hit a record high of $12,960 a ton earlier in the session on benchmark three month copper on the London Metal Exchange. Steel Authority of India (SAIL) shares followed, rising over 4 percent. Tata Steel, Vedanta and Jindal Steel & Power shares rose more than 2 percent each. Hindustan Zinc shares gained nearly 2 percent, while APL Apollo Tubes and JSW Steel shares gained more than 1 percent each. Welspun Corp and Hindalco Industries shares gained nearly 1 percent each, while National Aluminium (NALCO), NMDC and Adani Enterprises shares were trading in the green with marginal gains. What lies ahead? Looking ahead, momentum in metal stocks could sustain, though volatility cannot be ruled out, said Dasani. Global steel demand is projected to grow only modestly through 2030, but ex-China consumption and infrastructure spending in emerging markets should still underpin a gradual uptrend in volumes. In India, government capex and housing demand remain key tailwinds for steel makers, the analyst added. Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director at Vibhavangal Anukulakara said that metals are still vulnerable to changes in global demand, currency fluctuations and rate expectations. Hence the rise can go on, but there will be bouts of volatility and occasional pullbacks as markets digest macro data and look for global growth drivers, according to the analyst. For the near term, the trade looks supported as long as the dollar stays soft and the Fed leans dovish, but any abrupt US data surprise or fresh concerns around China’s exports could trigger sharp corrections, Dasani noted, adding that for investors, this is a classic cyclical rally: focus on balance-sheet strength and cost-efficient producers rather than chasing every spike.

316,Fintech,Fintechs leverage new-age tech to minimize loan default risks,"April 20, 2020 / 19:39 IST","Sandeep Anandampillai India’s formal banking sector has long been plagued with bad debts. According to the RBI, public sector banks lost INR 1.07 lakh crore in bad debts in the previous fiscal year. Central bank data reviewed by Reuters revealed that Indian banks wrote off over USD 30 billion worth of bad debt in FY 2018-19. While these write-offs eased India’s bad debt pile, the underlying problem was unresolved. Weak balance sheets coupled with the ambiguity around the non-performing assets (NPA) only added to the woes. The Yes Bank crisis further suggests that the bad-debt problem isn’t restricted to public banks. Instead, it can have a far-reaching impact on the overall economy. Private sector banks, NFBCs, peer-to-peer lending platforms are also bearing the brunt of loan defaults. This scenario draws attention to the inadequacy of traditional credit rating and underwriting methods. The need of the hour is a robust, tech-driven credit rating system that helps lenders mitigate credit risks and weed out bad cases early on. Fintechs can play a critical role here by collaborating with banks and other financial institutions to create transparent, auditable risk measurement frameworks. OPTIMIZING LOAN DISTRIBUTION Banks have historically collected large volumes of customer data. However, this data is often unstructured and adds no value to the decision-making process. This is where artificial intelligence (AI) comes into the picture. Fintech companies use AI-powered automated tools to turn vast data sets from multiple, disparate sources into valuable insights. In addition to credit bureau data, this reservoir also includes alternative data like the prospective borrower’s educational background, employment history, daily transactions, utility and recurring payments, and social media activities. With direct access to actionable insights, they can build a loan distribution model that increases trust, reduces risk and in turn, the acquisition costs. Interestingly, the more data is fed into the system, the more accurate these insights become. With feedback systems, continuous learning algorithms and deep learning, the data labelling and data cleaning processes keep improving by the day. This leads to more accurate borrower profiles based on their true creditworthiness. For example, high-value loan disbursals by banks using tech-enabled methods like credit scoring and risk analytic engines such as Crediwatch, have led to more prudent credit disbursement systems. ENABLING FASTER DECISION-MAKING Human bias majorly influences decision-making, which resulted in loan frauds and NPAs. AI can streamline the credit underwriting process with little to no human intervention. By running the acquired data against a set of rules designed to determine acceptability, it helps lenders take an unbiased decision eliminating the scope for any anomalies. A predictive analytics-driven vertical approach enables lenders to analyze quantitative and qualitative risk factors to create a comprehensive borrower profile for assessment. Additionally, AI allows credit underwriters to focus on complex aspects like looking into other contingencies that the data may not reveal. Hence, the final decision ultimately lies with the lender, but AI-based technologies facilitate more accurate decision making in a faster manner.

317,Fintech,How Fintechs can deal with the rising delinquency rates,"April 20, 2020 / 19:55 IST","Vinita Bhatia In January 2020, credit bureau TransUnion Cibil noted that delinquency rates in housing loans and credit cards had gone up by 13 basis points (bps) and 10 bps, respectively. This finding for JAS 2019 was on a Y-o-Y basis. One reason for consumer credit quality worsening was due to easier lending standards as many new-agelenders rushed to provide loans to customers excluded by traditional financial institutions. This delinquency is unlikely to change. According to Abhay Kelkar, VP, Research and Consulting, TransUnion Cibil, flattening demand for large-ticket asset purchases was causing slower asset finance loan originations while consumers were increasingly turning to consumption credit products to help finance day-to-day expenses. The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic could exacerbate this situation as business activities pan-India have come to a standstill. With job security on the line and weakening economic sentiment, debt delinquency around auto, property and personal loans as well as credit card payments could rise. This is despite the three-month moratorium extended by banks. Easy access to loans now a trojan horse? Over the past couple of years, several fintech companies tried to bridge the lending gap for people unable to get loans from traditional financial institutions by relaxing their criteria for loan disbursement. According to Akash Gehani, Co-founder of Instamojo, this leads to extending loans with higher risk. “To add to that, a lot of these companies focused more on growing their loan books and didn’t invest enough in collections processes, which leads to heightened credit delinquency,” he noted. Considering the uptake for digital finance and online financial services, credit delinquency could impact the sustainability of fintech companies. Gehani observed that it usually takes a couple of cycles to assess the health of a credit business. “There was a lot of growth in the early days due to more loans being given out. But now that it has led to higher delinquencies, we will see many fintechs being unable to sustain their business operations,” he added. Technologies like AI and ML can go a long way in analysing a customer’s credit worthiness and determining their repayment intent and future behaviour. However, this is possible only where there is significant amount of data about those customers. In the absence of such data, companies have to rely on others entities who have the data, or traditional sources like credit bureaus. What the pandemic has taught industry stakeholders is doing due diligence before extending credit to ensure their business sustainability. Like Kelkar pointed out, “The shift in consumer credit demand warrants ongoing monitoring to understand the impact on lender portfolios.”",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/fintech-how-fintechs-can-deal-with-the-rising-delinquency-rates-5168731.html
318,Fintech,GenAI improving high-technology access for more people and companies: Flipkart and Navi founder Sachin Bansal,"April 02, 2024 / 12:54 IST","Digital financial services firm Navi is deploying generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to detect customer fraud and falsification of information, its founder and managing director Sachin Bansal told Moneycontrol in an exclusive interview. According to him, large language models or LLMs are good at extracting data from videos and images, a capability that is being put to use by the fintech firm. For instance, if a customer looks like a 20-year-old and the age provided in the PAN card gives the age as 40 years, that's potentially a fraud signal for the company. “This fraud detection of age or gender, like the Aadhaar card says female and person is male... And let's say the address that they have put down is a residential address, but they are at a shop somewhere, things like that... Those paradigms will be very interesting to explore. It could do things which humans can't even do or we will have to put like an army of people to do those things,” Bansal said. Read the full interview here Having made a fortune at the time he exited the country's largest e-commerce company, the Flipkart co-founder, invested a large chunk to start Navi, a digital and mobile-first financial services company. Given his strengths in technology, Navi was expected to use the most advanced technologies to scale up. Bansal said that AI could impact different areas and could range from small incremental benefits to paradigm changes. Navi has deployed ChatGPT, the chatbot that first caught the world's attention, and several other free AI models. It is using Microsoft’s Copilot AI tool for coding. According to Bansal, these tools are helping augment humans and making them more productive. “GPT continues to be the best as of now. The other area that it will apply is in data annotation work, it's able to do it much faster. And I think over time, we could even use it for (credit) underwriting as well. For example, Copilot can help in complete paradigm changes. Things that we couldn't even do with humans,” Bansal said. Also read: Premium for good governance will be very high, says Sachin Bansal As of now, Navi’s 80-strong data science team looks at different AI models and their applicability for  Navi. While it is a horizontal function that could affect various divisions, Bansal said that a team focussing on AI can add more value to the time and effort to create specialised models for the firm. “It is a specialised function. It is not that anybody and everybody can do it well. Anyone can do a decent job of it. Let's say if you and I can sit and maybe write decent prompts. But to do an excellent job of it, I think it requires a bit of nuance,” Bansal said. According to him, the rise of AI has enhanced the respect for technology among the banking fraternity. “Now you can go online and try it yourself and see the result, you can see the power of it. So I think that has changed everything quite a bit. Now there is more curiosity and respect for what tech can do in finance,” he added. Bansal added that there are pitfalls, pointing to the controversy at ChatGPT developer OpenAI which led to turmoil in its management, or Google’s GenAI offering Gemini having several oops moments. “We have to be very careful because new technologies are unproven and unknown. What if they react randomly in some other way that we haven't thought of, especially the AI models? I mean, we don't know whether LLM has a brain of its own, it has an agenda of its own, trying to manipulate us,” Bansal said. He is also hopeful of AI improving high-end technology access for more people and companies at a much lower cost, which could have far-reaching implications. “These models are getting better. The techniques—they are coming up with new research all the time. This allows them to become more compute efficient, use less computing power, and use less power (over time),” Bansal said, addressing concerns about GenAI and LLM being power-guzzling, thus adding to the climate change challenge. Navi is not planning to invest or develop its LLM but sees itself as a big user as it matures and becomes cheaper. In fact, Bansal said that he is impressed with the capability of Open AI’s ChatGPT to handle Indian languages. “I don't see any bias... The ability to handle Indian languages is excellent. If somebody's talking in Kashmiri, their bot will reply in Kashmiri,” Bansal said, indicating that even a language used by a relatively small segment of the country’s population is well covered by the ChatGPT.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/genai-improving-high-technology-access-for-more-people-and-companies-flipkart-and-navi-founder-sachin-bansal-12490481.html
319,Fintech,Coforge shares rise even as analysts say $2.35-bn deal to buy Encora 'bold' but earnings dilutive,"December 29, 2025 / 10:23 IST","The shares of Coforge rose more than 2 percent in the morning trading hours of December 29 after the IT firm said that it will acquire US-based engineering services company Encora in a $2.35-billion all-stock transaction. The shares of the IT firm rose to Rs 1,711 apiece in the early trading hours of Monday, snapping a three-session losing streak. This comes even as brokerages remain divergent about their views on the impact of the acquisition of the AI firm. Coforge to acquire US-based AI firm Encora: In an exchange filing released in the post market hours of December 26, Coforge said that the acquisition will be executed through a share swap, under which the company will issue 93.8 million equity shares at Rs 1,815.91 apiece, implying a non-cash consideration of about Rs 17,032 crore. Encora shareholders will hold about 21.25 percent of Coforge’s post-issue equity capital. ""Coforge's acquisition of Encora will create a $2.5 billion Tech Services powerhouse with both the scale and capability across AI-led engineering, Cloud, and Data services to drive enterprise-grade AI-solutions,"" a release by the company read after it concluded its board meeting. Earlier, Moneycontrol exclusively reported that Coforge is in advanced discussions to acquire Encora, potentially marking one of the largest transactions in the digital engineering space, citing sources. Here's what brokerages say: Macquarie remained bullish on the shares of the company, double-upgrading its rating to 'Outperform' from 'Underperform' and raising its target price to Rs 2,230 apiece. This implies an upside potential of over 33 percent from the stock's previous closing price. The international brokerage believes that the acquisition of Encora will improve Coforge's service portfolio, and view this deal as a positive in the long term as it can accelerate Coforge's revenue growth, according to CNBC-TV18. Macquarie now expects longer-term sustainable revenue growth to be 15-18 percent. Elara Capital downgraded Coforge shares to ‘Reduce’ from ‘Accumulate’, and lowered its target price for the stock to Rs 1,720 per share from Rs 2,120 per share. The latest target price implies an upside potential of nearly 3 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The domestic brokerage noted that the acquisition will possibly help Coforge address its gaps in the North American market. However, valuations at EV/sales of 3.9x appear expensive considering that Encora posted only 7-10 percent organic revenue growth in the past two years, lower than Coforge’s revenue growth, it added. “Historically (in FY21-25), Coforge had reported high teen revenue CAGR on account of stable management, strong order book and specialization in select verticals of BFS, Insurance and Travel. Encora’s organic revenue growth, on the other ha nd, was lower at 7-10%. Despite lower growth, COFORGE is acquiring Encora at 3.9X EV/sales and ~21x EV/EBITDA, in line with COFORGE ’s multiples, which appears expensive. So, we cut our target multiple for COFORGE from 39x to 34x to reflect higher valuation concern. Organically also, some costs for COFORGE witnessed an uptick in recent quarters, which may strain its margins, going ahead. Thus, we cut our earnings estimates by 7–8% for FY27E and FY28E, respectively,” it said. Motilal Oswal Financial Services noted that the scale of transaction is large, therefore execution remains critical. Integration, leadership retention, margin management post-integration, and amortization will be the key monitorables. It however said that the vertical mix, primarily hi-tech and healthcare, is a positive, especially given Coforge’s strategic intent to scale these segments. “We believe Coforge’s strong executable order book and resilient client spending across verticals bode well for its organic business. This acquisition expands Coforge’s presence in the Hi-Tech and Healthcare verticals, though we have not yet incorporated Encora's numbers into our valuation. We continue to view Coforge as a structurally strong mid-tier player well-placed to benefit from vendor consolidation/cost-takeout deals and digital transformation,” the domestic brokerage said, while reiterating its ‘Buy’ call on the stock and a target price of Rs 2,500 per share, implying an upside potential of 49 percent. JM Financial said that the valuation looks rich given Encora’s 7 – 10 percent growth profile, CNBC-TV18 reported. Morgan Stanley analysts called the deal a ""bold move"", but said that the price tag appears expensive and is likely to be dilutive to earnings. Coforge's preference share issue creates an overhang once the lock-in period ends, Morgan Stanley added, forecasting a 12–13 percent decline in the stock. DAM Capital analysts said deal to be EPS dilutive, especially since price paid is higher than the firm's current valuation.

CEO Ryan McInerney said, emphasising the potential for collaboration and growth within India's dynamic fintech landscape. In his first trip to India after assuming CEO’s role in November 2022, McInerney was blown away by the country's digital payment scene, especially by UPI, QR codes and soundboxes, hailing the country’s digital payments innovations as transformative forces. “What happened with UPI in India is nothing short of remarkable,"" remarked McInerney.

322,Fintech,Riding the technology wave in emerging payments space,"June 04, 2020 / 17:21 IST","Radhakrishna Venketeshwaran In late 2016, when India moved to curb its cash-driven economy through the infamous demonetisation of bank notes, it also paved the way towards digitalisation for the entire nation. The inexorable move promoted by the government’s push towards its adoption and a synergy between tech companies and financial service providers further helped with the switch. This fundamental change in the payments industry is enabled by the rapid adoption of payment tech by retailers and a greenfield of over a billion consumers. Mobile commerce is the dominant factor in this trend, already accounting for 48 percent of digital commerce sales and forecasted to reach 70 percent by 2022. As mobile technology evolves, more and more consumers are expected to use alternate payment methods to shop. Retailers across verticals will need to be equipped to accept newer payment technologies while facing the difficult problem of bridging the gap between emerging mobile payment trends and meeting consumers’ expectations at the point of sale (POS). As technology evolves, competition amongst fintech players will also advance; while user interface will still have some weightage, it is enhancing user experience that will yield higher user engagement. Technologies like 5G and big data will help customers with not only their preferences and decoding their needs, but also helping retailers gauge their trust. Here are four major technological drivers in the emerging payments space that will drive the financial sector- • Big Data – Big data is one of the most used buzzwords in the fintech sector and is often used to denote a large, diverse, and complex set of data. From solving an intricate range of business problems to adapting technological advances, the fintech sector is highly data intensive. Proliferation of big data has made the process of converting data into meaningful insights seamless and delivering a personalised customer experience possible. Responding to even the tiniest query raised by a consumer is a game changer and data mining technologies enable this real-time while serving tailored content to engage consumers when they explore a retailer’s website or online store. For businesses, using big data can give a considerable push to their company in terms of profits, acquiring and retaining customers, improved targeting and risk reduction. Big data can also help companies keep-up with regulatory requirements and scrutinise transactions for money laundering and fraud. Some of these processes are still conducted manually, and if these processes are replaced by big data analytics tools, it can help businesses increase agility and balance overall cost. • Building a mobile payment platform – Financial and non-financial institutions can leverage digital wallets and mobile payments to facilitate new ways to pay and get paid. By building a mobile platform for one’s business, one can yield higher revenue through new customer spend, harness the potential of digital wallets and power mobile payments in-store. To increase engagement and customer appeal, digital wallet/mobile app solutions can seamlessly transfer stored value through code-based payment in-store. Integrating a mobile payment solution can help businesses expand their reach and create omnichannel access by connecting mobile customers with in-store code-based payments. Building such platforms will also help in empowering cash-in and checkout for the digital savvy and cash-preferred customer. For retailers, it will increase brand visibility, traffic and sales and help them reduce payment friction. • 5G technology – With mobile usage in India accelerating at a rapid pace, consumers from tier-2 and tier-3 markets are also seeking services to match the evolving technologies in their mobile devices. By the end of this year, India is expected to implement 5G networks to accelerate its “Digital India"" and “Make in India"" initiatives, along with the ambition to be at par with its global counterparts. The implementation of 5G will push the existing operating financial models to employ disruptive technology in their business. While consumers will experience this technology with speed, connectivity to millions of smartphones and AI-driven devices, they are yet to unveil the full potential of 5G when it comes to enhancing their banking experience. Therefore, 5G will enable higher productivity with connected devices and will also champion superior, customised and digital financial experience in the coming years. • Mixed Reality (MR)- MR technologies are a combination of characteristics of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR); it can blend the digital and physical worlds seamlessly. The combination of real and virtual worlds allows consumers to move within and communicate with both worlds simultaneously. While its popularity is prevalent in video games and the entertainment industry, retailers have already started implementing MR-driven technologies in the fintech sector. Their potential applications include consumers using MR to visualise their merchandise before they make a purchase, e.g. trying on a dress or test-driving a car virtually before purchasing. While 5G will facilitate these emerging technologies to scale up to enterprise-level, its impact has truly begun to disrupt many industries, including finance. In India, the historical reliance on physical currency may hinder its move to a digital economy to an extent, but adoption of traditional payment methods are nonetheless expected to grow because of their ability to retain anonymity. Additionally, the ongoing pandemic has changed the course of the payment ecosystem with contactless payments becoming the new norm. The crisis could eventually end up helping the industry to accelerate the rush to digitisation. There is an opportunity now more than ever for fintech innovation to be mobile-first and couple the attractive appeal of mobile payments with global consumer demands for on-the-go access. Substituting electronic payments may largely become acceptable for even micropayments soon, a trend that will likely be structural and permanent.

324,Fintech,Rise of Digital-only Financial Products and its implications for marketers,"June 02, 2020 / 20:42 IST","Aditya Saxena The advent of digital neo banks, insurtech, and mobile-only financial services have made a seismic change in the financial sector across the world. In emerging economies, the implications are even more profound, and the new entrants are undoubtedly benefitting from bespoke marketing strategies. Banking at fingertips In 2019, JP Morgan Chase had to pull the shutter down on Finn, its digital-only bank. One of the critical reasons for this was not being able to create enough differentiation between its branch banking and digital bank offerings. It is crucial to transfer the cost benefits achieved by not having a physical branch presence, to the customers, in the form of lower fees, lucrative offers, and higher yields. And these core propositions for non-branch banking should pan out in the way of geo-specific offers that need to be conveyed clearly and consistently across websites, social media channels, and paid media campaigns. Clear and transparent messaging on services, benefits in terms of returns and offers, and communication on other value-added services would build credibility for digital-only banks and financial services providers in the long run. Carving the niche and marking the territory As per CBInsights, more than 50 percent of millennials in the US like to access a full range of banking services on their mobile phones and are 2.5x more likely to switch banks than their previous generations. World over, 18-34 years old customers are driving this paradigm shift by adopting digital-only challenger banks. In India, digital-first offerings from several leading banks are available, such as Kotak Bank and others. Marketing of banking products to millennials has always been challenging. A majority of them have unique financial goals and require guidance and personalized advice for their specific life stage. For example, Chime, a California-based digital-only bank, has created a dedicated inbound marketing platform geared towards providing millennials financial advisory. Digital banks are also reaching out to their target audience through social media and content channels like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube, where they are partnering for endorsements from demographic influencers and celebrities, and speaking in the language millennials understand. Data is a crucial value driver Digital-only financial products and platforms thrive on real-time availability of data. The strength of available data becomes a great enabler in driving value for both customers and marketers. Digital native prospects that constitute the primary Target Group can be targeted with personalized messages and offers based on historic demand signals on digital channels, thereby increasing the likelihood of conversions. Marketers can also target existing customers with cross-selling and localized offers to drive more significant differentiation and value. Backed by machine learning algorithms, digital banking platforms can make real-time investment recommendations and spending alerts. All these measures lead to a higher degree of customer engagement and loyalty. In the absence of physical branch experience, marketers can leverage site/app analytics data to continually enhance customer experience, which is free from technical glitches, higher page load times, and other on-page or in-app elements that cause friction between the bank and customer. ""Friction will be the biggest killer of bank revenue in the next ten years,"" writes Brett King, in his book Bank 4.0. With right measurement techniques, well-defined KPIs, and seamless UX across devices, marketers can bring the CSAT success enjoyed thus far by companies like Uber and Amazon to the digital finance sector as well. Why is it essential for developing economies? According to a study by McKinsey Global Institute, digital accounts are 90 percent cheaper than conventional accounts. Riding on increased mobile and internet penetration, digital-only banks and financial products can ensure financial inclusion while onboarding lower-income customers in emerging economies like India. Full-service digital bank account services launched in India during recent years provide higher than the average interest rate, no minimum balance, and free online money transfers. Similarly, several players in the growing Indian fintech industry, like InstantPay, Namaste Credit, and Payzello, provide SMB credit and personal finance management services to customers. The burgeoning ecosystem of digital-only players will, on the one hand, bring greater financial inclusion for customers and also increase competition in an already competitive market. Marketers need to realize this as an opportunity to fine-tune the online messaging of their core product offerings and advertise in a multi-layered targeted approach depending on demography, device and predicted psychography, to co-create value for both businesses and customers.

325,Fintech,"Concerns over asset quality, risk management may have prompted RBI's crackdown on NBFCs: Experts","March 06, 2024 / 13:06 IST","The recent regulatory action by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on some fintechs and non-banking financial companies (NBFC) could be due to concerns over asset quality, risk management, and credit underwriting standards, experts told Moneycontrol. Over the past few months, the central bank has imposed restrictions on various companies, including Paytm Payments Bank, IIFL Finance, JM Financial, Bajaj Finance and M&M Finance. Industry experts and veterans opined that the RBI may have been alarmed by the aggressive growth in the unsecured loans of some entities. ""There could be some asset quality worries that the RBI would have seen mostly after the jump in unsecured lending by these entities. They (RBI) impose monetary penalties which these entities pay and get off with. Hence, the strict restrictions could be due to concerns over the risk management by the entities,"" said Shymala Gopinath, former Deputy Governor, RBI.  Additionally, Aseem Dhru, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of SBFC, a fintech, said regulators keep highlighting concerns and issues to companies. ""The RBI has been proactively watching this financial space and it is clearly saying that we are not just watching and punishing, but we will come down heavily on anything that is not in line,"" Dhru said. RBI's regulatory hammer On March 5, the central bank barred JM Financial Products from issuing loans against shares and debentures, including sanctioning and disbursing loans against the Initial Public Offering (IPO) of shares. In addition, some media reports said the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) will soon come out with an order on JM Financial Products for its alleged role in inflating its IPO price. A day earlier, RBI asked IIFL Finance to stop sanctioning or disbursing gold loans with immediate effect, noting ""supervisory concerns"" in the company's gold loan portfolio. On January 31, the RBI imposed business restrictions on Paytm Payments Bank, citing repeated violations of norms and non-compliance with multiple rules. And on November 15, the RBI directed Bajaj Finance to stop sanctioning and disbursing loans under its two lending products, ‘eCOM’ and ‘Insta EMI Card’, with immediate effect. Gopinath said that post the global financial crisis in 2008, RBI's focus has been more on strengthening supervision. ""During the pandemic, there were a lot of complaints from borrowers about some fintechs and digital lenders. Some borrowers even committed suicide.

Owing to the advancement of software industries, business innovation are being driven ahead of time, in order to remain competitive. When it comes to the Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) industry, companies are rallying behind smart automation to provide the best possible user experience to its customers and fulfill their never-ending demands. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is considered as the essential step towards automation. A recent report by IDC revealed that RPA market will grow up to 49.3 percent in India with the increasing demand for automated accounting and process management by 2022. It is believed that RPA would be more accurately described as part of a continuum of technology-enabled initiatives to create intelligence into automation of business processes. The amalgamation of technology with service industry and human capabilities helps re-imagine business processes efficiently and delivers greener business outcomes for their stakeholders, effectively. Today, enterprises provide a practical, non-invasive way to build, scale, and secure automated business processes across verticals. Using software robots, which mimic UI-based human actions to perform everyday tasks, one can keep the underlying IT infrastructure intact. Robots interact with apps and systems just like people do but they are faster, more accurate, highly secure and always awake, thereby saving time, cutting costs and increase employee productivity - free human employees to focus more on strategic tasks. For a financial service industry, software solutions are worth investing in, as the work gets completed in a cost-effective way.

Uncertain times are looming at large. In such a scenario what actions and plans business-to-business marketers should take? Should they look at website content revamp?

Here are some pointers for marketers in these times and for a post-pandemic era– that is, if there ever is one. The degree to which each business focuses on these will vary depending on each industry and growth stage.

336,Fintech,"When Fintechs met FM: No mention of Paytm, Nirmala Sitharaman lends a patient ear & more","February 27, 2024 / 17:20 IST","Around 40 fintech entrepreneurs, non-fintech founders and think tanks assembled late evening in Delhi on February 26, 2024, for a meeting with Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, RBI Deputy Governor Rabi Sankar, and other government officials. They gathered a month after the banking regulator imposed severe restrictions on Paytm Payments Bank Limited (PPBL) due to compliance issues and regulatory overhang. A group of founders had written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) urging them to reconsider the recent sanctions against PPBL and engage in constructive dialogue with the Fintech ecosystem. Also Read: Group of Indian startup founders write to PM Modi, FM, RBI urging rollback of sanctions on Paytm When FM Sitharaman walked into the room, she referenced a recent action on a “large fintech” without naming Paytm and the open letter. “12 founders signed the open letter, only 6 of them have shown up today”, she is learnt to have said, adding that the ministry was keen to listen to their concerns and take feedback. Paytm absent Yet for the next 60 minutes, not a single founder brought up the elephant in the room- Paytm. While one founder who attended the meeting said most fintechs anyway didn’t sign the open letter, a second founder who signed said the RBI had provided clarity on most issues in the last few weeks, thereby negating the issue. A third founder said, “The folks who signed the open letter were in fact more effusive in their praise of the Government and the regulator. Perhaps they didn’t want to risk upsetting the FM or the RBI. Besides, we all have our own clarifications that we want from the government Also Read: Paytm, Axis Bank to submit TPAP application for UPI business with NPCI this week Startup founders including Murugavel Janakiraman of Bharat Matrimony, Deepak Shenoy of CapitalMind, Ritesh Malik of Innov8, Vishal Gondal of GOQii, Yashish Dahiya of PB Fintech and Rajesh Magow of MakeMyTrip had signed the letter sent to RBI and Finance Ministry. MDR, KYC, etc. So what did the founders, the government and the RBI discuss? Over refreshments and dry fruits at North Block, the group of 40 discussed everything from Merchant Discount Rate (MDR), the labyrinth of Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations to self-management of retirement accounts in the country. The Finance Minister said she didn’t want to make a speech and encouraged all of them to come forward with their concerns instead. “It was a very progressive meet. Everyone got two minutes to talk about the issues they have. The FM was in a listening mode,” said a fourth founder, who had his first face-to-face meeting with the minister. It did not turn out to be a “fear-placating” exercise, said another,  rather it seemed like a window for fintech firms to speak out on their own specific set of issues and industry topics that need government’s attention. “The ministry officials made note of all the points we made and asked everyone to share detailed notes on the same. The meeting was mostly to say that the government is listening and taking feedback,” said another member. Along with founders of top fintech and non-fintech firms, Union Minister of State for Finance Bhagwat Kishanrao Karad, Vivek Joshi, Secretary, Department of Financial Services (DFS), Rajesh Kumar Singh, Secretary, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), S. Krishnan, Secretary, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), T. Rabi Sankar, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) were among the several high-profile government dignitaries present. Sources said fintech companies, including Cred, Jupiter, Policybazaar, CapitalMind, Razorpay, PhonePe, Billdesk, Lendingkart, Innov8, and M2P, were present at the meeting. Governance in focus However, without naming Paytm, the FM reiterated the need to make corporate governance stricter within companies. “FM spoke about how once the companies become large, they have to make corporate governance very strict and follow compliance norms meticulously. Fintechs should not assume that a situation can be managed. It is not how regulations work is what she said,” another founder who attended the meeting told Moneycontrol. Without naming anyone, FM said that some startups tend to make such assumptions. Key outcome One of the main outcomes of the meet was that there will be monthly calls between the regulator and fintechs wherein, the latter can seek clarity on any regulations and get feedback. Some of the topics of discussion were industry-wide. For instance, a founder spoke on a way to create a common format or a single mechanism for KYC. “Different sets of documents are needed at different organizations. This is a hassle for the end customer. There was a common pitch for a way to resolve this,” said a founder of a lending firm. Speaking of collaboration, another discussion revolved around building some kind of a universal fraud detection system like a public tech platform that can be used by payment companies to check digital frauds. If companies across insurance, mutual funds, and lending can pool data at a common source, it may be helpful to cull out bad agents/fraudsters in the payments system. Self-Regulatory Organisation (SRO) also found a mention as the industry prepares to submit feedback at the end of the month. Another topic was on how to make capital accessible and affordable for MSMEs by fintech through lending. Also Read: Coming soon: A new regulator to monitor your fintech apps. Here's what a fintech SRO can do “There were vast topics discussed including data-sharing, investments to entities owned and controlled by Indian promoters and NRIs, KYC norms, foreign direct investment to startups, cybersecurity, and MDR as well,” said a head of an industry body. Some fintech founders used this as an opportunity to speak with Ministry officials on the sidelines, for a more detailed chat. As one of the outcomes, RBI, DPIIT and MoF will look at the change of ownership holding/control of listed fintech companies to enable them to be in-sync with regulatory compliance, the ministry said in a statement. Further, DPIIT mentioned that new patent examiners have been added which will reduce the turn-around-time of patent applications.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/when-fintechs-met-fm-no-mention-of-paytm-nirmala-sitharaman-lends-a-patient-ear-more-12364231.html

340,Fintech,Cryptocurrencies open up new investment opportunity amid Covid-19 crisis,"April 22, 2020 / 16:32 IST","Nischal Shetty Amid the volatile stock market, especially after the global COVID 19 outbreak, the Supreme Court of India’s verdict to overturn the Reserve Bank of India’s ban order against cryptocurrencies is giving a fresh lease of life to the stakeholders of the Indian cryptocurrency sector. They are now optimistic about embracing this investment avenue under the gloomy economic conditions. The RBI, in its command, had assumed that virtual currencies posed a systemic risk to the banking system and it was purely inane. Till earlier this year, the market capitalization of the global cryptocurrency market was valued at USD 261 billion, marking a growth of around USD 70 billion since the beginning of 2020. This figure is about USD 15 billion more than what India added to its GDP back in 2017-2018 – a period when India’s economy was moving upward at the fastest pace in recent times. The numbers bear out that the global crypto market is growing at an exceptional pace. The growing interest of investors towards global crypto market Besides China, where the government is already pushing multiple blockchain projects, funds and local crypto champions, nations such as Iran and Russia too are leveraging the fertile ground of the current geopolitical climate to double their cryptocurrency efforts. In fact, the Bank of England’s governor Mark Carney too has announced a digital Synthetic Hegemonic Currency, similar to Facebook’s Libra cryptocoin, as an alternative to the dollar. During the coronavirus contagion, there were concerns about slowing global economic growth and seething trade tensions. However, the US stock markets had still performed strongly by the middle of February with the tech-heavy Nasdaq rising 8.5 percent and S&P 500 up by 4.3 percent. Other national stock markets were doing well too with Australian markets up by 6.9 percent and Italy up by 7.3 percent. Gold too had climbed 6.22 percent year to date. But earlier in March, the cryptocurrency market suffered an intense sell-off due to the continuing pandemic. It witnessed a downfall in its value worth USD 93.5 billion within 24 hours and a 48 percent crash in the price of bitcoin. Much of the selling off of cryptocurrencies happened in the equity market. However, over the past few years, bitcoin has been compared to digital gold and some are seeing it as the safest asset to invest in when markets are under pressure as it has returned a whopping 2,332,803 percent during 2010 and 2019. Compare that to the 189 percent returns of the S&P 500 and 19 percent returns that gold has given over the same time frame. Considering that they have been the best performers all this while, conventional institutional investors are once again showing interest in the leading cryptocurrency as today it stands at a value of nearly USD 7000. The RBI’s ban order in 2018 had already pushed the country’s crypto community to step back and either shut shop or move their operations overseas. However, on the brighter side, Indian cryptocurrency startups like WazirX are gaining ground to help India get over the policy paralysis and stay relevant amid the global interest. Being the largest cryptocurrency exchange, the platform has recorded its daily volume grow by over 70 percent during March 2020. Return of Indian investors in the crypto game With a population of more than 1 billion, the Indian market is a sleeping giant and RBI’s crypto ban lift will now bring a massive boost in crypto adoption in India, thus empowering traders to streamline their investment plans. There is yet another advantage that users can now sell their crypto investments and get the cash directly into their bank accounts, which previously was prohibited. Although, this does indicate that cryptocurrencies are here to stay as a new investment avenue for the potential investors, they should be cautiously optimistic before pledging their money. In this situation, regulations adopted by the Indian policy makers will be the key variable in determining the pace at which the country’s citizens will adopt cryptocurrencies.

341,Fintech,Tiger Global-backed fintech Jar to enter P2P lending business with Jar Plus,"March 11, 2024 / 16:59 IST","Tiger Global-backed micro-savings platform Jar is set to enter the peer-to-peer (P2P) lending business, ‘Jar Plus’, in partnership with the non-banking financial company (NBFC) LenDenClub. “Jar Plus is in the testing phase and is being rolled out to a handful of customers within the Jar platform. The firm is mostly receiving feedback and implementing it right now. Rollout will take some more time,” A source aware of the developments told Moneycontrol. P2P lending is a system connecting borrowers and lenders directly. Platforms like Jar will help NBFCs in sourcing customers and the NBFCs will evaluate the borrowers and obtain prior consent from the lenders to disburse the amount as a loan.  This is considered a high-return alternate investment mechanism. “There is a massive opportunity for this segment. If a player abides by all the RBI regulations, it can help lenders earn high returns on the money they decide to lend,” the person quoted above said. Also Read: All you need to know about peer-to-peer lending platforms Rising competition In 2021, Fintech platform CRED said launched its P2P lending product called Mint for its members. CRED Mint was launched in partnership with Liquiloans, an RBI-registered P2P NBFC. Similarly, In 2022, announced the launch of an investment platform for its merchant partners. BharatPe’s P2P investment product is powered through RBI-regulated NBFCs- LenDenClub and Liquiloans. BharatPe was also working on providing its merchants an option to invest in Fixed Deposits by Unity Small Finance Bank. Buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) startup Uni Cards in 2023 acquired OHMY Technologies (OMLP2P), a peer-to-peer lending platform that is licensed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to operate as an NBFC-P2P platform. RBI is tightening regulations on this segment After digital lending, P2P lending has come on the RBI’s radar as some platforms were observed to be working outside the preview of the guidelines, including flaws in the KYC process. Also Read: Exclusive: RBI said to Up Scrutiny of P2P Lenders, asks platforms to Share Financial Data The regulator has engaged with all licensed platforms via email, besides conducting supervisory visits at their offices in New Delhi and Mumbai since September. Post-reviews, corrective measures were handed out to individual firms, which continue to engage with the RBI. Jar's lending partner, LenDenClub also counts players like PostPe, Google Pay, Capital Trust and KarmaLife as its P2P partner. The Jar app was founded in 2021 by Nishchay AG and Misbah Ashraf, and is built on the idea of helping Indians make investing a habit. In February of 2022,  the startup bagged $32 million in Series A funding led by US investment firm Tiger Global. The Jar app, which can look at the transaction history, rounds up an individual’s daily spending and puts some money aside as an investment.

343,Fintech,Signzy launches video conferencing tool for secure communications between banks and customers,"September 26, 2020 / 13:15 IST","India’s leading RegTech startup Signzy has launched a Video Conferencing (VC) tool for secure, private one-to-one communication between banks and other financial institutions on one hand, and their customers on the other. The Signzy VC tool uses Artificial Intelligence to enhance security and reliability and thus aims to deliver seamless business continuity for banks, FIs and other organizations during the prevailing national lockdown. It has been designed for enabling front-end processes that necessitate a face-to-face conversation with the customer. “Generic video conferencing apps and tools are simply not designed for banking-grade security and privacy and are thus unsuitable for use in financial services industry’s customer-facing workflows. Signzy’s Video Conferencing tool on the other hand delivers industry-leading security and privacy for one-to-one interactions and is therefore best suited for banks, insurance companies and other organizations where security and privacy of communications is a critical requirement,” said Ankit Ratan, the co-founder of Signzy. Signzy’s video conferencing tool is honed with numerous layers of checks and balances including, AI-enabled video forensics and identity document checks that eliminate security gaps by combining human scrutiny with both software and ML and AI-enabled learning. The tool ensures seamless communication and end-to-end encryption along with securing data leakage. For example, a bank can choose to disable client-side video controls during a call, which would prevent a customer from switching off the video while the call is in progress. Further, the AI technology ensures that all calls can be audited and any breach in the protocol can be readily caught. “Since this has been developed with banks as intended users, no other third-party software currently matches this level of security,” Ankit added. In the wake of global COVID-19 pandemic and India’s nationwide lockdown, banks have been encouraging their customers to use digital channels for transactions as far as possible. Many banks have adopted video KYC as a 100% digital KYC process for new customer onboarding and customer verification. Signzy’s VC tool allows banks, insurance companies and other financial services providers to go a few steps further and use secure video conferencing for other processes that otherwise necessitate a face-to-face interaction with the customer, inside the branch or at the customer’s premises. For example, client relationship managers can schedule a secure video call with their clients for processing certain types of financial transactions.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/fintech-signzy-launches-video-conferencing-tool-for-secure-communications-between-banks-and-customers-5150921.html

345,Fintech,Parked banking dreams for now; focus is on stabilising lending business: Navi founder Sachin Bansal,"April 02, 2024 / 10:06 IST","Amazon founder Jeff Bezos used to say that every day is day one for the company, meaning that however old an organisation is, it should treat each day as its first day. Sachin Bansal, who built the Indian ecommerce platform Flipkart, which today rivals Amazon’s might and money in India, appears to live by this ethos. Years after exiting Flipkart, now owned by Walmart, Bansal is fully engrossed in running his fintech startup Navi, which already has more than Rs 7,500 crore in assets under management (AUM). Bansal says that he puts in somewhere between 80-100 hours every week, adding that he does not expect his colleagues to do the same. In a rare and detailed interview with Moneycontrol, the usually reticent Bansal spoke about regulation, fintechs, startup governance, the emergence of Generative Artificial Intelligence, banking ambitions and Navi’s journey as a financial services company. Edited excerpts: Fintechs’ impact on the ecosystem is quite large from service delivery as well as the customer mindset change point of view. Given the context of this growth, how do you see the recent regulatory action in multiple areas as well as on a few companies? I would say digital finance or in general digitisation of finance as a theme is something that is here to stay. Regulators know that this is the most efficient way to deliver finance to the masses. So, I think it will become larger and larger. I would not like to comment on specific players. But if you see the trend from the last couple of years, there was this credit card model that was looked at. Then there was the first loss default guarantee (FLDG) model, where fintechs paid lenders a fixed sum when customers defaulted, that was looked at. Then digital lending guidelines were brought in. Then there was this MeitY (Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology) issue that happened. So, if you see the sequence and then this, I think it is just maturing of the ecosystem. I think the regulator is trying to get a grip on how to regulate this space. And as their understanding is becoming deeper and deeper, their actions are becoming firmer. There are parallels with the microfinance industry and what happened over there. It took years to settle down. Do you believe that regulation here is tougher for startups compared to other geographies? Frankly, I don't have direct operations experience in other geographies. But people who know, and who have seen both Indian and other geographies, say that it’s more regulated outside India. The financial services space is quite highly regulated in the US, Europe and UK and those mature geographies. India is on the path to becoming more mature in every aspect of finance. Coming to Navi, we are talking at a time when you've kicked off your third non-convertible debentures (NCD) issue. How will you utilise it? How have you been performing? We have grown quite nicely. This is our third issuance. The first two were big successes. I think we have been increasing the size of issuance every time. And the company has grown as well. Our ratings have improved since the last time and profitability has improved. And our, of course, scale is much bigger as well, at around Rs 7,500 crore AUM as of September. In the September and December quarters, we made about Rs 35-40 crore of profit after tax each quarter. The demand in NCDs is very good but demand outside of NCDs is also very good for us, even after the recent change in risk-weighted assets that the RBI did for unsecured loans,  because most of our business is unsecured. So, what's the proportion of home loans? Our home loan business has been growing as per our expectations. Close to 10 percent of our book today is home loans. We are building this business for the long term. So, we know that in the short term, our cost of capital is slightly higher, and because of that we are taking it a little slow. But that's a deliberate decision. Of course, we can go fast, but as I said, the cost of capital must match up. Eventually, our cost of capital will come down, so we will become more competitive. As of now, we are getting into some co-lending arrangements for home loans. Is that a double-edged sword situation, when you do have co-lending partnerships? I mean, how do you see that on a long-term basis? We have co-lending partnerships even in our personal loan business and that's going very well. And that is a programme that we run with multiple partners. We have six partners, and we are in the process of onboarding four more. It has been very profitable. I think our partners are very happy with the results so far, and we are also very happy with the results, because co-lending releases capital for us and makes us more capital efficient. Who does the underwriting in your co-lending partnerships? It's a joint underwriting. Both partners must do it. Is it because you focus on big-ticket loans, unlike a lot of fintechs, which mostly play in the small-ticket category, so it doesn't make sense for them to acquire at a very high cost? Again, I can't comment on others, but we have taken a view that we want to serve the middle-income population in the country, which we believe is going to be the largest population and which is a sweet spot—they have good incomes, they have good credit scores, and they are still not getting access to credit easily. So that's like a very nice, sweet spot that we have got. Extremely well, like high creditworthy customers, just that access to finance has not reached there yet. Is this also why you got out of microfinance? No. I think microfinance was an amazing business. I loved it. But at the end, post our bank license was declined, it did not work well for our business model. It was a strategic investment which fitted into our bank license aspirations. So, post that, what we are doing is it then became a great financial investment, right, and not a strategic fit for us eventually. Have you given up on your banking dreams? Not really. For now, I would say we have parked them, until we see that it is a possibility again in the future. Then we will pick up again when there's some green light from the regulator at the right time. But this time when you apply, you will not have a vehicle like Chaitanya (in the microfinance business), right? So, how will you go about it? Hopefully, by that time we will have a good history of our own. So, I think Navi, on its own, should be able to apply for a licence at the right time. What was your learning from not getting a banking licence? I think we have to wait for the regulator to come and say, ""Yes, we are open to it. We are looking to issue more licenses."" I think that's what we need. I think that's what we probably, in hindsight, mistimed, that we didn't read the regulator's mood properly. But the lending segment that you mentioned, the middle income segment, isn't it the same segment that almost everyone is going after, including, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank… The intention is there. But do they have the mechanisms to reach there? Our belief is that building a very large feet-on-street salesforce to reach these customers and then doing lots of paper KYCs and paper underwriting and collection of documents and everything is an extremely costly affair. I mean, eventually, they pass on these costs to the customer in the form of an interest rate or processing fee or something like that. But now, people want to do everything on their phone. They don't want to visit branches and take out printouts. So you mentioned going outside of this. Are you focusing more on tier 2 cities? Two-thirds of our business comes from outside the top 10 cities, which is big. And we go to tier 3, tier 4 cities as well. So, tier 2, tier 3, tier 4 is kind of almost two-thirds of our business. Collections are going very well in these areas as well. So, what's your ideal target ticket size? Our median is between Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh. That's where we are operating. But how will you make money on this? We are profitable. I think we can make money because we are digital. We have cut out paperwork. We spend very little on marketing. We don't have agents doing feet on street. So how do you reach these people? At the start, we did a lot of marketing a couple of years ago, but now we have completely stopped. More than 75 percent of our business is organic. I think our app is one of the top six apps in the Play store in the finance section. We are now just going to start our marketing on UPI. But that is not necessarily for payments, right? It is mostly for buying or repayment of loans on your platform? No, it's not just like that. And UPI is now a duopoly, right? I think UPI still, market share-wise, looks like a duopoly kind of thing. But we believe there's new stuff to be done over there. We will announce it when it comes. We believe we can bring a new angle to UPI, which we will try. Give us a few months, we have some things we're doing and we are hoping it will work. What else is in your product pipeline? I think most of my focus is to stabilise the lending business. Lending is one of the hardest businesses, especially when you are doing it digitally. I think my complete focus is to make sure that we get the collections right, we get the credit cost right, we get the partnerships right, and of course funding right, through this bond issuance that we are doing. So, we've been setting this engine in place, so that it becomes self-sustaining and starts churning out cash. You're still the 100% owner of Navi? 97 percent. Are you not planning to bring on other investors? No. We will keep talking to people. At the right time, we will get somebody on board. And you will revive plans for an IPO? We tried a year ago. The timing was bad, I think. So, I am hoping that in a few months, once we are ready, we will… Is Navi’s growth something that you imagined or is it slower? The way Flipkart scaled in 10 years, was unimaginable. How did you recalibrate that in your mind? No. I think the recalibration was slightly on the other side, which is that of the customer: how do you think about customers? Because here, a transaction lasts years. So, if you give out a loan, it's a two-year loan on average. If you sell a health insurance policy, it's a minimum four or five years with the customer. So, you're taking on risk essentially with a transaction. So, you have to be very, very carefully calibrated and careful about every transaction. Even in Flipkart, when we started, we didn't really have any expectation that we'll grow as fast as we can and as fast as we should. Are you already using AI in your business, in your workforce? We just started using generative AI in a few areas. And it's giving decent results. I think customer support is an obvious one where it lends itself very well. I think, in general, the other areas that will apply in, for example, data annotation work, it's able to do it much faster. We started using copilot (Microsoft) for coding. That's also going very well. And I think over time, even things like fraud detection—we just started using it for fraud detection—and other things, and underwriting as well. Will it help in underwriting in terms of tracking the historical patterns of potential customers? I think traditional data science models are much better at doing that. Where these generative AI models will help is extracting data from videos and images. What’s your view on the surround sound around startups from a governance standpoint? The premium for good governance will be very high now. I think we took governance for granted. I mean, I am saying myself, as an operator in the startup space, and as a small-time investor, I kind of took governance mostly for granted—that most of the founders are from good backgrounds. But I think it has to be something that has to be put in place deliberately. Have your thoughts about work-from-home, and work-from-office changed? No. We were very clear that we want to be work-from-office. Work from home was a temporary phenomenon in my mind. It was never a permanent one. We are 100 percent work from office. Zero work from home. Have you stopped being an angel investor? Yeah, I have completely stopped. I am completely immersed here. Spending a lot of time in office, almost weekends also. Sometimes people hate me for that. First is there is no work from home and then you must come on weekends also, but yeah, I am spending like 80-100 hours a week. I mean, I don't expect others to do it, but I am myself spending a lot of time. Because business is such an exciting space right now. It requires a lot of attention to small details.

346,Fintech,Coronavirus pandemic | Staying relevant through virtual events,"April 21, 2020 / 19:26 IST","V Bhatia COVID-19 has brought businesses globally to a standstill with social-distancing resulting in the postponement of all industry and company-specific events. Indian companies are following the lead of global brands like Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon and encouraging employees to work from home. While this permits a modicum of business continuity, it has affected their team’s learning and development (L&D) activities. In domains like fintech, such activities are important as employees need to be trained on the latest technologies and regulatory norms. Often, these processes are interconnected with those of various financial institutions that fintechs partner with. Atul Todi, CEO and co-founder, 10Times said that realising the need for ongoing L&D activities, fintech companies are leveraging the online ecosystem to virtually deliver the necessary upskilling and re-skilling training to their employees. Lots of solutions built for industries like online-education are now being applied for the online webinar space. A case in point is Finastra’s ‘Behind the Hype: Applications of AI in Fintech’ to be held on April 16, 2020 that explores different applications of AI and machine learning in the domain. “By leveraging live-streaming solutions, mixed with engagement and gamification features, organizations are focusing on retaining their target audience and keeping them engaged. Also, unlike physical events, where crowd management is often hard, virtual events have opened up a whole new set of data analytics-driven optimization methodologies. Lastly, while online events take away the charm of physical proximity, they are cost-effective since companies need not spend on physical infrastructure, which typically comprises a major chunk of the cost,” Todi added. POPULARITY OF VIRTUAL EVENTS The merits of virtual events far outweigh its limitations, from an organizer’s and attendee’s perspective. For instance, the online ecosystem eliminates geographical restrictions, drives cost-efficiency, and provides the facility of accessing recorded material later. What is making these events popular is that the platform also provides all the tools for hosting optimized meet-ups and workshops. This has come as a boon for companies amid the current lockdown. However, can virtual events build humanly-relationships, especially in domains like fintech where automation is prevalent? According to Todi, any event brings together people bound by a common objective. “For industries like fintech, which deal with a lot of automation and processes, virtual events provide the perfect platforms that new-age players can access to make valuable connections and, in the process, feel human,” he noted. Fintech companies can leverage virtual events for business networking with customers; especially in this age of impersonal chatbots, robocalls and online communications. While these automated tools get work done, they might not necessarily help in building relationships or closing a new business deal. Fintech business relies on constant innovation, L&D, networking and relationship building. When offline is not an option, online events permits people to interact with others in-person, albeit virtually. At least, the show goes on.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/fintech-staying-relevant-through-virtual-events-5173451.html
347,Economy,"Metal stocks rise for 8th day as global prices soar, Hind Copper, SAIL shares jump up to 15%; what lies ahead?","December 29, 2025 / 10:50 IST","The shares of metal companies surged for the eighth consecutive session on December 29, with heavyweights like Hindustan Copper, SAIL, Tata Steel and others surging up to 15 percent. Analysts have decoded the reasons behind the recent surge in the stocks, and what lies ahead. The sharp rise in the metal stocks today pushed the Nifty Metal index up 1.5 percent to 10,967.75, as seen at 9.55 am on Monday. Earlier during the day, the index hit a fresh 52-week high of 10,983.20. The index has now gained around 5 percent in eight sessions of gains so far. Why are metal stocks rising? The sharp rise in the metal stocks has been supported by a favourable global macro setup rather than a single trigger, said Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS. ""Recent sessions saw Nifty Metal and key names like Hindustan Copper, Hindalco, Vedanta and SAIL push to fresh highs, aided by broad-based buying across ferrous and non-ferrous counters. Turnover has picked up, signalling institutional interest returning after a weak November,"" the analyst said. Fed rate cut hopes: The sharp rise in metal stocks comes on the back of rising metal prices, due to expectations of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in US in 2026, said Aditya Welekar, Senior Research Analyst - Metals, Axis Securities. ""The easing labor market in the U.S. provides the Fed with the opportunity to lower rates, which bodes well for the metals market,"" he said. China's policy support: A key driver has been China, where incremental policy support for infrastructure, power grids, renewable energy and urban redevelopment is improving demand visibility for steel, copper, aluminium and zinc, Dasani added. “While the property sector remains weak, state-led capex and industrial activity have stabilised, helping metal prices find a floor,” he said. Tight supply: Tight inventories across several base metals have further limited downside risk despite uneven global growth, said Dasani. Welekar from Axis Securities also noted that the supply side for both precious metals and base metals like copper and aluminum is constrained, while demand remains strong. ""The demand for silver and base metals is largely driven by the ongoing needs of electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy, and advancements in artificial intelligence (AI),"" he added. Softer US dollar: Another important tailwind has been the softer US dollar. ""With markets pricing in a gradual easing cycle in the US, the dollar index has eased from recent highs, supporting dollar-denominated commodities. Lower real yields have also improved the relative attractiveness of metals. On the supply side, mining disruptions, higher energy costs and stricter environmental norms have constrained fresh capacity additions, particularly in refined metals, just as demand from energy transition themes such as electric vehicles, power transmission and renewable infrastructure remains steady,"" said Dasani. Rally in commodity prices: The current rally in gold, silver, and copper reflects a tightening physical supply environment rather than just paper-market enthusiasm, said Charmi Shah, Business Head at Wealth1. ""Silver and copper have been running structural deficits for years. In silver, demand from solar, electronics, and EV supply chains has consistently outpaced mine supply, while inventories across major exchanges remain thin. Copper, central to electrification and energy transition themes, continues to face underinvestment in new mines, long gestation periods, and declining ore grades. These constraints are now becoming visible in pricing,"" she said. Gold's strength, meanwhile, is being reinforced by aggressive central bank accumulation across emerging markets, particularly as countries seek diversification away from fiat currencies and sovereign debt, Shah said, adding that China’s buying interest across gold, silver, and industrial metals has further amplified the rally, especially at a time when global supply chains remain fragile. Top metal gainers today: Hindustan Copper shares jumped around 7 percent to trade at Rs 508.05 apiece.  Earlier during the day, the stock jumped around 15 percent to hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 545.95 apiece. This comes as copper prices hit new all-time high levels. Copper hit a record high of $12,960 a ton earlier in the session on benchmark three month copper on the London Metal Exchange. Steel Authority of India (SAIL) shares followed, rising over 4 percent. Tata Steel, Vedanta and Jindal Steel & Power shares rose more than 2 percent each. Hindustan Zinc shares gained nearly 2 percent, while APL Apollo Tubes and JSW Steel shares gained more than 1 percent each. Welspun Corp and Hindalco Industries shares gained nearly 1 percent each, while National Aluminium (NALCO), NMDC and Adani Enterprises shares were trading in the green with marginal gains. What lies ahead? Looking ahead, momentum in metal stocks could sustain, though volatility cannot be ruled out, said Dasani. Global steel demand is projected to grow only modestly through 2030, but ex-China consumption and infrastructure spending in emerging markets should still underpin a gradual uptrend in volumes. In India, government capex and housing demand remain key tailwinds for steel makers, the analyst added. Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director at Vibhavangal Anukulakara said that metals are still vulnerable to changes in global demand, currency fluctuations and rate expectations. Hence the rise can go on, but there will be bouts of volatility and occasional pullbacks as markets digest macro data and look for global growth drivers, according to the analyst. For the near term, the trade looks supported as long as the dollar stays soft and the Fed leans dovish, but any abrupt US data surprise or fresh concerns around China’s exports could trigger sharp corrections, Dasani noted, adding that for investors, this is a classic cyclical rally: focus on balance-sheet strength and cost-efficient producers rather than chasing every spike.

He was in Pimpri-Chinchwad on Sunday to campaign for the January 15 elections. ""For the sake of the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation elections, the 'clock' and the 'tutari' (trumpet) have united. The parivar has come together,"" he said. Pawar urged party workers to work hard and refrain from making any controversial comments during rallies. ""We are the ones who work for development. We will edge out those who tried to put this municipal corporation in debt,"" he said. Meanwhile, talks between the two parties are underway for a tie-up for the Pune Municipal Corporation polls.

The two initiatives -- the Shipbuilding Financial Assistance Scheme (SBFAS) and the Shipbuilding Development Scheme (SbDS) -- are aimed at strengthening the country's domestic shipbuilding capacity and improving global competitiveness, as per an official statement. Under SBFAS, which has a total corpus of Rs 24,736 crore, the government will provide financial assistance of 15-25 per cent per vessel, depending on the category of the vessel. The SbDS, with a budgetary outlay of Rs 19,989 crore, focuses on long-term capacity and capability creation. Union Minister of Ports, Shipping and Waterways (MoPSW), Sarbananda Sonowal said that these guidelines create a stable and transparent framework that will revive domestic shipbuilding, boosting forward and backward linkages, the official statement said. It said the scheme introduces graded support for small normal, large normal, and specialised vessels, with stage-wise disbursement linked to defined milestones and backed by security instruments. Incentives for series orders are also included, the statement added. The scheme also provides for the establishment of a National Shipbuilding Mission to ensure coordinated planning and execution of shipbuilding initiatives. It also introduces a shipbreaking credit note, under which ship owners scrapping vessels at Indian yards will receive a credit equivalent to 40 per cent of the scrap value, linking ship recycling with new ship construction and supporting a circular economy approach. According to the statement, independent valuation and milestone-based assessments have been made mandatory to strengthen governance and ensure efficient use of public funds. Over the next decade, the statement said, SBFAS is expected to support shipbuilding projects worth about Rs 96,000 crore, stimulate domestic manufacturing, and generate employment across the maritime value chain. According to the statement, the scheme provides for the development of greenfield shipbuilding clusters, expansion and modernisation of existing brownfield shipyards, and the establishment of an India Ship Technology Centre under the Indian Maritime University to support research, design, innovation and skills development. Under SbDS, the statement said, greenfield shipbuilding clusters will receive 100 per cent capital support for common maritime and internal infrastructure through a 50:50 Centre-state special purpose vehicle, while existing shipyards will be eligible for 25 per cent capital assistance for brownfield expansion of critical infrastructure such as dry docks, shiplifts, fabrication facilities, and automation systems. With the creation of modern infrastructure and a skilled workforce, commercial shipbuilding capacity is projected to rise to about 4.5 million gross tonnage per annum by 2047, as per the statement. ""Both SBFAS and SbDS will remain valid until March 31, 2036, with an in-principle extension envisaged up to 2047,"" the statement said, adding that together, the schemes are expected to generate employment, promote indigenous technology development and strengthen India's maritime security and economic resilience.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/government-rolls-out-rs-44-700-crore-shipbuilding-boost-eyes-2047-capacity-leap-13745606.html
353,Economy,Coforge shares rise even as analysts say $2.35-bn deal to buy Encora 'bold' but earnings dilutive,"December 29, 2025 / 10:23 IST","The shares of Coforge rose more than 2 percent in the morning trading hours of December 29 after the IT firm said that it will acquire US-based engineering services company Encora in a $2.35-billion all-stock transaction. The shares of the IT firm rose to Rs 1,711 apiece in the early trading hours of Monday, snapping a three-session losing streak. This comes even as brokerages remain divergent about their views on the impact of the acquisition of the AI firm. Coforge to acquire US-based AI firm Encora: In an exchange filing released in the post market hours of December 26, Coforge said that the acquisition will be executed through a share swap, under which the company will issue 93.8 million equity shares at Rs 1,815.91 apiece, implying a non-cash consideration of about Rs 17,032 crore. Encora shareholders will hold about 21.25 percent of Coforge’s post-issue equity capital. ""Coforge's acquisition of Encora will create a $2.5 billion Tech Services powerhouse with both the scale and capability across AI-led engineering, Cloud, and Data services to drive enterprise-grade AI-solutions,"" a release by the company read after it concluded its board meeting. Earlier, Moneycontrol exclusively reported that Coforge is in advanced discussions to acquire Encora, potentially marking one of the largest transactions in the digital engineering space, citing sources. Here's what brokerages say: Macquarie remained bullish on the shares of the company, double-upgrading its rating to 'Outperform' from 'Underperform' and raising its target price to Rs 2,230 apiece. This implies an upside potential of over 33 percent from the stock's previous closing price. The international brokerage believes that the acquisition of Encora will improve Coforge's service portfolio, and view this deal as a positive in the long term as it can accelerate Coforge's revenue growth, according to CNBC-TV18. Macquarie now expects longer-term sustainable revenue growth to be 15-18 percent. Elara Capital downgraded Coforge shares to ‘Reduce’ from ‘Accumulate’, and lowered its target price for the stock to Rs 1,720 per share from Rs 2,120 per share. The latest target price implies an upside potential of nearly 3 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The domestic brokerage noted that the acquisition will possibly help Coforge address its gaps in the North American market. However, valuations at EV/sales of 3.9x appear expensive considering that Encora posted only 7-10 percent organic revenue growth in the past two years, lower than Coforge’s revenue growth, it added. “Historically (in FY21-25), Coforge had reported high teen revenue CAGR on account of stable management, strong order book and specialization in select verticals of BFS, Insurance and Travel. Encora’s organic revenue growth, on the other ha nd, was lower at 7-10%. Despite lower growth, COFORGE is acquiring Encora at 3.9X EV/sales and ~21x EV/EBITDA, in line with COFORGE ’s multiples, which appears expensive. So, we cut our target multiple for COFORGE from 39x to 34x to reflect higher valuation concern. Organically also, some costs for COFORGE witnessed an uptick in recent quarters, which may strain its margins, going ahead. Thus, we cut our earnings estimates by 7–8% for FY27E and FY28E, respectively,” it said. Motilal Oswal Financial Services noted that the scale of transaction is large, therefore execution remains critical. Integration, leadership retention, margin management post-integration, and amortization will be the key monitorables. It however said that the vertical mix, primarily hi-tech and healthcare, is a positive, especially given Coforge’s strategic intent to scale these segments. “We believe Coforge’s strong executable order book and resilient client spending across verticals bode well for its organic business. This acquisition expands Coforge’s presence in the Hi-Tech and Healthcare verticals, though we have not yet incorporated Encora's numbers into our valuation. We continue to view Coforge as a structurally strong mid-tier player well-placed to benefit from vendor consolidation/cost-takeout deals and digital transformation,” the domestic brokerage said, while reiterating its ‘Buy’ call on the stock and a target price of Rs 2,500 per share, implying an upside potential of 49 percent. JM Financial said that the valuation looks rich given Encora’s 7 – 10 percent growth profile, CNBC-TV18 reported. Morgan Stanley analysts called the deal a ""bold move"", but said that the price tag appears expensive and is likely to be dilutive to earnings. Coforge's preference share issue creates an overhang once the lock-in period ends, Morgan Stanley added, forecasting a 12–13 percent decline in the stock. DAM Capital analysts said deal to be EPS dilutive, especially since price paid is higher than the firm's current valuation.

354,Economy,NZ–India FTA to open new visa window as Indian mobility slows across key categories,"December 26, 2025 / 13:31 IST","New Zealand’s decision to extend specialised work visas to India under the proposed free trade agreement comes at a strategically significant moment, as Indian migration flows into the country have begun to cool across several major visa categories. The new arrangement under which India will be placed on par with countries such as China and the Philippines is expected to ease labour market access for Indian professionals, strengthen mobility channels and potentially reverse the recent slowdown in approvals. Work and residence approvals soften The moderation is visible even in traditionally high-volume streams. Work visa approvals, which peaked at over 42,000 in 2023, have eased to about 27,500 in 2025 (January–November). A sharper correction is evident in residence approvals, which fell from 39,432 in 2022 to just 9,543 so far in 2025. While part of the 2022 surge reflected post-pandemic backlog clearances and policy resets, the subsequent decline points to a structurally tighter approval environment. Student flows volatile, scrutiny rising Student mobility has also been uneven. Approvals dropped sharply after 2019 due to pandemic disruptions, rebounded strongly in 2023 and 2024, but rejection rates have climbed again. More than 6,500 Indian student applications were declined in 2023, with over 3,300 rejections recorded in 2025 so far, suggesting increased scrutiny even as demand remains resilient. Approval ratios across residence, work and student visas remain positive overall, but the margin has narrowed compared with the pre-2019 period. Declines in work visa approvals rose sharply in 2023 and have stayed elevated through 2024–25, while student rejection rates have climbed noticeably in the post-pandemic phase. FTA-linked visa shift Against this backdrop, the proposed specialised work visa window under the recently concluded talks on the NZ–India FTA represents a meaningful policy shift. By extending to India the same framework available to other priority labour-supplying nations, New Zealand is signalling its recognition of India as a key source of skilled labour. The move is expected to provide Indian professionals with more predictable and assured entry pathways, particularly in sectors facing persistent labour shortages such as healthcare, IT services, engineering and specialised trades. Taken together, the data suggests the FTA’s mobility chapter is not just complementary to trade liberalisation, but timely, arriving just as traditional visa routes show signs of fatigue.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/nz-india-fta-to-open-new-visa-window-as-indian-mobility-slows-across-key-categories-13743535.html
355,Economy,Centre likely to cut debt-to-GDP ratio to around 55% in FY27: Report,"December 29, 2025 / 10:11 IST","The Centre is considering a target of lowering the debt-to-GDP ratio to around 54.5-55 per cent in FY27, compared with the 56.1 per cent estimated for FY26, Business Standard has learnt from a government official. The move would signal a continued, but calibrated, approach to fiscal consolidation in the coming financial year. A final decision on the FY27 consolidation strategy will hinge on the economic growth outlook, which will be reassessed after the release of the first advance estimates of GDP for FY26 on January 7, the official told Business Standard on condition of anonymity. The government is expected to adopt a moderate consolidation path rather than an aggressive tightening, the official added. In the FY26 Union Budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman repositioned the debt-to-GDP ratio as the government's main fiscal anchor, replacing the long-standing practice of treating the fiscal deficit as the primary operational target. Under the revised glide path outlined in Budget documents reviewed by Business Standard, the Centre aims to bring its debt burden down to 50 per cent of GDP by FY31, allowing for a deviation of one percentage point on either side. The Medium-Term Fiscal Policy-cum-Fiscal Policy Strategy Statement tabled alongside the FY26 Budget mapped the Centre's debt trajectory for FY27 to FY31 under three nominal GDP growth assumptions - 10 per cent, 10.5 per cent and 11 per cent. For each growth scenario, the statement outlined mild, moderate and high consolidation paths, offering flexibility depending on the extent of fiscal tightening chosen by the government, Business Standard reported. The strategy, the statement said, is intended to provide operational room to respond to unexpected developments while ensuring that central government debt remains on a transparent and sustainable path. While annual fiscal deficit targets will continue to be announced in future Budgets, these numbers will now be derived from the debt objective rather than acting as the primary fiscal goal. Presenting the FY26 Budget, Sitharaman underlined that the government's focus would be on keeping yearly fiscal deficits aligned with a declining debt trajectory. For FY26, the Centre has pegged the fiscal deficit at 4.4 per cent of GDP, lower than the revised estimate of 4.8 per cent for FY25. Earlier this month, she informed Parliament that the debt-to-GDP ratio for FY26 would stand at 56.1 per cent, while flagging concerns over rising debt-to-GSDP ratios at the state level, Business Standard noted. The International Monetary Fund, in its latest Article IV consultation on India, has advised the government to reassess its medium-term debt target and make it more ambitious by factoring in state government liabilities. Faster fiscal consolidation, the Fund said, would help bring down debt-servicing costs sooner and rebuild buffers against future economic shocks, Business Standard reported. Meanwhile, CareEdge Ratings has projected a slightly slower pace of consolidation, estimating the fiscal deficit for FY27 at 4.2-4.3 per cent of GDP. Even so, the ratings agency believes the Centre could reduce its debt ratio to around 50 per cent, with a one-percentage-point margin, by FY31 if nominal GDP growth averages about 10.7 per cent over the next five years.

Though the wish list is long, some of the key items which merit urgent attention are: # Revamping the Tax deduction at source (TDS) regime - While the new Act has tabulated all the TDS provisions, making it easier for taxpayers to locate and refer to the correct section, the structural reforms in TDS framework are still awaited. TDS compliances drain a lot of resources. It is time that this regime gets a complete makeover. Rethink is required on the foundational aspects, namely, if there is still a need for TDS to be used as a primary source of establishing transaction trails. Due to technological developments and digitisation of the Indian economy, it may be evaluated if the GST framework is now more suited to take up this responsibility. The information exchange between the different departments and extent of reporting under the Statement of Financial Transaction Framework (SFT) framework also supports the idea that there are other alternatives which can support this transition. TDS could now be used to establish transaction trail, as a backstop, only in cases where transaction trail is not available from these sources. Further, not all TDS sections garner significant resources for the government. Thrust should be to identify and retain those key TDS sections i.e. where collections are high. The ones which have a miniscule contribution to the overall kitty, could either be deleted or merged. Multiplicity of TDS rates also creates confusion. Currently there are rates ranging from 0.1% to 35%. It is desirable that only 2-3 rates are considered. Also, the requirement to issue TDS certificates could be dispensed with, considering the information is already available in form 26AS and Annual Information Statement (AIS). These measures will help reduce compliance burden on taxpayers and mitigate litigation on interpretation issues including application of correct rates. # Dealing with pendency at Commissioner of Income tax (CIT(A))- Tax dispute resolution remains a pressing challenge and stronger measures are required for timely closure. The taxpayer aggrieved with an assessment order files an appeal before the CIT(A), being the first appellate authority. As per some recent reports, as of 31 March 2025 around 5.39 lakh appeals are pending before CIT (A), with the disputed amount of Rs 16.7 lakh crore.  These numbers highlight the magnitude of the issue. There is a need for a stricter mandate to dispose of the appeal within prescribed timelines provided under Act. This would help reduce litigation cost, ensure timely resolution and unclog the system. It is equally important to assess the address of the resource gap in the tax department, which leads to delays, despite genuine intent to address these challenges. # Detailed guidance on General Anti Avoidance Rule (statutory GAAR) – With the GAAR panel being operational, we are likely to see more cases where statutory GAAR is invoked by the tax department. With this emerges the need for detailed guidance on every facet of statutory GAAR. Most of the mature GAAR jurisdictions provide detailed guidance on how statutory GAAR would apply in different scenarios. This guidance is also regularly updated. It helps the taxpayers to have a better understanding of what to stay away from to avoid tax controversies. Statutory GAAR in India can be invoked if main purpose of the arrangement is to obtain tax benefit and one of the four tainted element tests is met. These tests are commercial substance test, misuse or abuse test, arm’s length test and bona fide purpose test. While the Act provides some guidance on how to construe when an arrangement “ lacks commercial substance”, but detailed guidance on other three tainted elements is needed. Similarly, guidance is needed on how the main object of an arrangement is to be ascertained, in cases there are multiple objects. How to address a situation when some of the objectives cannot be quantified? Case studies would surely help. It is also desirable that clarity be provided on whether judicial anti-avoidance principles (judicial GAAR) continue to apply alongside codified statutory GAAR. One of the key rationales of introduction of statutory GAAR was to codify the doctrine of substance over form, laid down by courts. Hence, parallel application of this doctrine, now when statutory GAAR is operational may not be warranted. In recent past there has been uptick of litigation on the interplay between statutory GAAR and judicial GAAR.  It is also important to note that while statutory GAAR has tax thresholds, grandfathering provisions and requirement of referral to GAAR panel, there are no such limitations in case of judicial GAAR. Hence, this issue needs to be suitably addressed. Also, while the Act lays down a detailed procedure of referral to the GAAR panel for invocation of statutory GAAR, this avenue is not available when the Principal Purpose Test (PPT) is invoked to deny tax treaty benefit.  Application on PPT on a taxpayers’ case also requires the same degree of care as invocation of statutory GAAR. Hence, it is desirable that GAAR panel route is also prescribed for such cases. To conclude, there is a lot of expectation that the government will look at these critical concerns of taxpayers and suitably address them in the upcoming Budget.

357,Economy,"Australia, UAE FTAs deliver gains for Indian exporters, but competition bites in many segments","December 24, 2025 / 16:55 IST","India’s recent free trade agreements with Australia and the United Arab Emirates have produced a mixed—but largely encouraging—outcome, with Indian exporters gaining market share across a substantial portion of product categories, even as meaningful losses persist in several others. A Moneycontrol analysis of post-FTA trade data shows that both agreements have helped Indian firms deepen their presence where competitiveness, scale and tariff preferences aligned—but have also exposed vulnerabilities in segments where these advantages were weaker. Australia: Broad-based gains, but not universal Since the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (ECTA) came into force, India has strengthened its export footprint across a wide swathe of the Australian market. India’s share of Australia’s imports rose by more than one percentage point in 857 product categories, covering nearly 79 percent of the total traded value analysed. In practical terms, this suggests that across most economically significant product lines, Indian exporters were able to leverage tariff concessions, clearer regulatory pathways and improved market access to expand their presence. However, the gains were far from universal. In 2,072 product categories, India’s share of Australian imports declined by more than one percentage point. These setbacks point to areas where Indian firms may be struggling on pricing, product standards, logistics, or scale, or where domestic Australian producers and third-country suppliers have outperformed. Sectorally, India recorded notable gains in passenger vehicles, diamonds and pharmaceuticals, while losing ground in categories such as cast articles of iron and steel, highlighting uneven competitiveness across manufacturing segments. UAE: Larger market, tougher competition India’s experience under the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) follows a similar pattern, though with sharper competitive churn. Indian exporters increased their import share by more than one percentage point in 1,597 product categories, accounting for about 61.5 percent of the total traded value examined. The gains are concentrated in sectors where India already had commercial depth and where tariff reductions amplified existing strengths—particularly manufactured goods, processed commodities and value-added segments. At the same time, the UAE market has proven more competitive than Australia’s. In 2,564 product categories, India’s share fell by more than one percentage point, suggesting stronger competition from alternative suppliers and the challenges of sustaining momentum in a highly diversified, price-sensitive hub that is deeply embedded in global supply chains. What the FTAs really show Taken together, the data underscores a critical point: preferential trade agreements alone do not guarantee lasting export gains. While tariff elimination and improved access can deliver early advantages, sustained success depends on competitiveness, quality, scale, branding and supply-chain reliability. The experience of Australia and the UAE suggests that FTAs can widen the playing field—but exporters still need to win on fundamentals to prevent erosion over time. The findings come as India steps up its FTA agenda. Earlier this week, the government announced the conclusion of negotiations with New Zealand, with a deal expected to be finalised in the first half of 2026. India has also signed an FTA with Oman earlier this month. As India expands its network of trade agreements, the lessons from Australia and the UAE are clear: FTAs open doors—but staying inside requires competitiveness well beyond tariff relief.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/australia-uae-ftas-deliver-gains-for-indian-exporters-but-competition-bites-in-many-segments-13741676.html

360,Economy,MC EXPLAINER      India's gig economy’s stress test: Why delivery workers are striking on Christmas and New Year’s Eve,"December 26, 2025 / 14:50 IST","India’s delivery apps are headed for a stress test. Gig workers linked to platforms such as Swiggy, Zomato, Blinkit, Zepto, Amazon and Flipkart have called a nationwide strike on December 25 and December 31, days when orders spike. Their complaint is straightforward: payouts are shrinking, delivery targets are getting tighter, and the 'welfare' part of gig work still looks mostly theoretical. The dates are deliberate. Christmas Day and New Year’s Eve are peak-demand moments for India’s app economy. Who is striking, and who is organising it The strike call comes from a growing ecosystem of gig worker unions, led by the Indian Federation of App-Based Transport Workers (IFAT) and the Telangana Gig and Platform Workers Union (TGPWU). These groups represent delivery partners, ride-hailing drivers and other platform workers across states. Women-led collectives such as the Gig and Platform Service Workers’ Union have also backed the action, underlining that gig work now spans far beyond young men on bikes. Organisers estimate that tens of thousands participated in the Christmas Day action through partial log-offs, rallies and bike marches. The December 31 strike is expected to be broader and more disruptive. What gig workers are protesting At the heart of the strike is a simple claim: the economics of gig work have quietly broken. Delivery workers say per-order payouts have fallen sharply even as fuel costs, vehicle maintenance and competition have risen. In some quick-commerce services, payouts for short trips have dropped to the point where riders say they must complete far more deliveries, often under extreme time pressure, just to earn what they did a year ago. That pressure has intensified with the rise of ultra-fast delivery models. Ten-minute grocery delivery has become a marketing promise. For workers, unions say, it translates into reckless deadlines, traffic risks and penalties if anything goes wrong. Then there is the issue that angers workers most: account deactivation. Delivery partners say their app IDs can be blocked over customer complaints or algorithmic flags, often without explanation or appeal. For a gig worker, deactivation is instant unemployment. Add long working hours, no paid leave, no guaranteed minimum wage, and limited insurance coverage, and the frustration has been building. The strike’s core demands reflect that reality: transparent and fair pay, safer delivery timelines, limits on arbitrary deactivations, structured grievance redressal, and access to basic social security. Why this moment feels different India has seen gig worker protests before. But this one feels bigger. Over the past five years, delivery riders, cab drivers and home-service workers have staged city-level strikes and flash protests, from ride-hailing driver shutdowns in Tamil Nadu to mass walkouts by Blinkit delivery workers after sudden pay cuts, to women beauticians protesting commission structures at Urban Company. What those protests lacked was scale and coordination. This time, unions are acting nationally. They are also strategically targeting peak demand days, when platforms are most vulnerable. There’s another reason the timing matters: policy. The policy backdrop: promises made, patience running out India officially recognised gig and platform workers only recently. The Code on Social Security, 2020, passed in 2020 and notified in late 2025, for the first time created a legal category for gig and platform workers. It requires digital platforms to contribute a small share of turnover to a social security fund meant to finance insurance and welfare schemes. On paper, it was a milestone. In practice, workers say, the benefits remain unclear and largely invisible. There is no guaranteed minimum income. No protection against sudden deactivation. No enforceable limits on working hours or delivery speeds. States have moved faster. Rajasthan, Bihar and Karnataka have passed their own gig worker welfare laws, with Karnataka’s statute going furthest, proposing welfare boards, platform levies and safeguards against arbitrary account suspensions. But implementation is uneven, and workers say platform behaviour on the ground has barely changed. The strike, unions argue, is about forcing those laws to matter. The platforms’ position and their silence Platform companies insist their models offer flexibility and opportunity. They point to accident insurance during active deliveries, incentive payouts, and the ability for workers to choose when to log in. What they do not dispute is that gig workers are not employees. During the Christmas strike, most major platforms declined to issue public statements. Behind the scenes, unions allege, companies relied on surge incentives and selective enforcement to keep services running, and, in some cases, retaliated against organisers. The lack of public engagement has only sharpened workers’ resolve ahead of December 31. A global story, with an Indian twist In California, voters approved Proposition 22, preserving contractor status while offering limited benefits, a compromise still fiercely contested. In Europe, regulators are pushing to reclassify many platform workers as employees, triggering resistance from tech companies. India’s path sits somewhere in between: recognising gig work as permanent and essential, but stopping short of employment rights. What makes India different is scale. The country already has millions of gig workers, and that number is expected to grow rapidly as platforms expand into smaller cities and logistics deepens. How India resolves this tension will shape the future of work for a vast, young workforce.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/india-s-gig-economy-s-stress-test-why-delivery-workers-are-striking-on-christmas-and-new-year-s-eve-13743643.html

Senior government sources said that around Rs 1.6 lakh crore grants – remain unreleased. Sources said the Centre has formally communicated to line ministries and states about the March 31 cut-off, and that procedural requirements must be completed within the remaining window. “We are clearly telling all ministries and states that disbursals under the 15th Finance Commission cannot happen after March 31. Whatever funds are pending have to be claimed by that date,” a senior government source told Moneycontrol, adding that claims are currently being received and processed. The pending grants are largely those that require recommendations or certification from line ministries before release to states. “These are grants meant for states, but they are released based on recommendations of concerned ministries,” the source said. Grants for the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) and National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) are routed through the relevant nodal ministries, while urban local body grants are recommended by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs and rural local body grants by the Ministry of Rural Development. Health sector infrastructure grants are processed through the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Post-devolution revenue deficit grants Sources said post-devolution revenue deficit grants — have been released almost in full. Unlike other grants, these are given directly to eligible states based on the Finance Commission’s recommendations and do not require claims to be filed. “We have already released about 78 percent of the total grants recommended by the Finance Commission, including the entire post-devolution revenue deficit component,” the government source said. “Wherever grants are still pending, it is largely because conditions need to be met or formal claims have to be submitted.” Unclaimed funds to lapse as savings The Centre has cautioned states that failure to complete procedural requirements in time will result in the unclaimed amounts lapsing. “If states are not able to claim the funds within the award period, it automatically results in savings. There is no carry-forward beyond March 31,” the source said. The government’s push comes as it prepares to close the current award cycle of the Fifteenth Finance Commission and transition to the next phase of fiscal transfers. Officials said the emphasis remains on ensuring that eligible states do not miss out on funds due to avoidable delays in documentation or inter-ministerial processes. Initially set for 2020–21 to 2024–25, the 15th commission's term was extended by a year to account for economic shifts and the covid pandemic. The 16th commission was set up in late 2023 and will offer recommendations for the next five-year period starting April 1, 2026.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/rs-1-6-lakh-crore-unreleased-centre-sets-march-31-deadline-for-pending-15th-finance-commission-claims-13740898.html

368,Economy,OPINION | Trump trade policy in 2025 didn’t work as it ignored Economics 101,"December 29, 2025 / 10:36 IST","When it comes to tariffs, during his first year this term President Trump has delivered much more than his campaign promise of 60% tariffs on US imports from China and up to 20% on imports from other countries. Martin Wolf of the Financial Times had correctly predicted that Trump’s first term tariffs would look like “relatively modest starter protectionism” in comparison with his second term trade policy. ‘Liberation Day’ and the illogical approach to reciprocity On April 2nd, 2025, which he called Liberation Day, Trump announced “reciprocal tariffs” on imports from every nation. India was slapped with a 25% “reciprocal tariff,” even though its own overall trade-weighted average tariff was 12%.  But the lack of reciprocity was much starker in the case of Taiwan, with its own tariffs at 2%, being imposed a “reciprocal tariff” of 32%. Reciprocity here was surprisingly defined in terms of trade balance. The reciprocal tariff rate on each country was one that the Trump administration believed, based on an erroneous formula, would bring the US’s bilateral trade deficit with that nation down to zero. Bad assumptions This reduction in the trade deficit was expected to be mainly through a reduction in US imports, unrealistically assuming exports to remain constant. Actually, the resulting exchange rate movements and rise in the cost of imported inputs were likely to shrink exports and limit reductions in imports. Additionally, built into their calculations was the unrealistic assumption of 25% pass-through of these tariffs into domestic prices faced by US consumers and import-using producers, in contrast to existing high-quality pass-through estimates of close to 100%. Forgetting Economics 101 Also, completely ignored was the basic economics of trade deficits and surpluses, which says that trade balances are governed not really by trade policies but by macroeconomic conditions and policies. And, finally, there has been no attention to the basic accounting identity that a current account (trade) deficit is always accompanied by a capital account surplus of the same magnitude. Thus, the attractiveness of American financial assets can drive a capital account surplus, and, thereby, a trade deficit. Therefore, it is shocking that the Trump administration, on the one hand, expresses its concern for trade deficits, and, on the other, brags about all the unenforceable promises of large investments by countries with whom the US has negotiated trade deals. Concluding asymmetric trade deals The Trump administration had also announced that it would use its Liberation Day tariffs as leverage in negotiating 90 trade deals in 90 days, but only a small fraction of those deals has been finalized in over 250 days so far. There have been a few highly asymmetric deals signed, mostly with much smaller countries like the Philippines and Vietnam. For example, in the case of Vietnam, while the US would charge 20% tariffs on goods coming straight from Vietnam and 40% on goods transshipped through it, Vietnam would not impose any tariffs on its imports of American products. As part of the somewhat asymmetric deals (biased in favor of the US) with Japan, South Korea and the European Union, the administration has claimed to have received promises of hundreds of billions of dollars of investments in the American economy, even though it is well understood that such investments widen the US trade deficit. There have also been some major trade deals with Latin American countries like El Salvador, Argentina, Ecuador, and Guatemala, whose goals have been to expand market access and solidify supply chains. China’s pushed back In its trade negotiations, the Trump administration, however, has encountered the biggest problems with the world’s two largest countries, namely China and India. While the US-China trade war had really escalated with the US imposing a 145% tariff on Chinese products and China reciprocating with 125%, the last few months have seen a temporary truce with much lower tariffs on each other, some relaxation of China’s rare earth export controls and China promising to buy American soybeans. No permanent deal has been reached yet, and trade tensions between the two countries are still strong. Regression in ties with India With India, there have been several rounds of talks, but the opening of India’s agricultural and dairy markets the US demands does not appear to be politically feasible. As a result, there is no final deal yet. In August, the US called off trade talks with India and doubled its tariffs on Indian products from 25% to 50%, the additional 25% being the penalty on India for buying Russian oil. This treatment, which made India feel singled out, has made matters worse in the India-US trade negotiations and their overall economic relations. It has pushed India, at least temporarily, to China’s and Russia’s side. Unsurprisingly, India has also been separately negotiating trade agreements with several other countries, most recently successfully with the UK, New Zealand and Oman. Political blowback triggers a partial rollback In view of rising grocery prices that were adversely affecting President Trump’s popularity ratings, a recent presidential executive order eliminated or considerably reduced tariffs on over 200 food and agricultural items. Roughly, over a billion dollars’ worth of India’s annual exports (tea, coffee, spices etc.) benefitted from these exemptions and reductions. But the 50% tariffs continue on India’s major exports (textiles, apparel, leather products etc). Legal challenge to presidential power over tariffs It is important to note here that there was recently a Supreme Court hearing on the legality of tariffs by presidential executive order under the International Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA). The argument is that the US Constitution provides only the US Congress (and not the President) with tax setting authority and a tariff is a tax. Lower courts, including the US Court of International Trade, have ruled that these tariffs are illegal, but they are currently in effect at least until the Supreme Court makes its decision. A decision against the Trump administration will provide a huge relief to Indian exporters. There would, however, be other avenues available to the Trump administration to impose tariffs but the process for those will be more elaborate, slower and longer. While there is no doubt that the Trump administration’s 50% tariffs hurt India, they have had some positive effects as well. They have successfully pushed India to negotiate free trade agreements with other countries, thereby diversifying their markets beyond the US. One could also argue that the recent developments with labor reforms are also a consequence of these harsh US tariffs. After all, these IEEPA tariffs could very well be ruled illegal by the US Supreme Court. And, just like grocery prices, if other rising prices start affecting Republican prospects at the 2026 midterm elections, there might be more tariff exemptions and withdrawals. And, anyways, a new administration three years down the road is expected to be prudent enough to get rid of these mindless and harmful tariffs.

369,Economy,Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | The final countdown,"December 26, 2025 / 14:24 IST","Dear Reader, The year is almost winding to a close and nostalgic wraps and futuristic outlooks have risen to a frenzy (we bring you some last-minute ones in our Reading List today). It is after all the final countdown, where we compare what we set out to achieve with what we actually did. US President Donald Trump has certainly achieved his goals. Trump had set out to levy tariffs on trading partners and kick immigrants out of America. The promise of tariffs has rung true albeit whittled down in many cases due to Trump’s trademark penchant for striking deals. Even as the US government hunted down undocumented immigrants, it tightened the rules for getting American citizenship and work visas, the latest being the H1B visa rules. In short, Trump has delivered his promise of making America more American although the impact of these on the economy is still being debated. The fact that the US economy grew by 4.3 percent in the third quarter has only strengthened the case for the Trump administration. For the rest of the world though, 2025 was disconcerting if not turbulent. As American exceptionalism was contested, it only made investors dig deeper into a bubbling stock market. Amid rising concerns over a bubble in Artificial Intelligence, the S&P 500 has soared, and dollars have returned to US markets in double speed. That has meant that emerging markets have buckled. India somehow has escaped with just bruises as domestic investors put their faith in the economy and corporate earnings. The year may have started as one made for equities, but it is winding down with the foreign exchange market at the centre of attention. Here, the Indian rupee has taken the dubious distinction of being the worst performing currency in emerging market exchange rates. Indeed, when the dollar’s hegemony was being threatened, investors resorted to buying gold (just like central bankers), other riskier assets and even select emerging market currencies. For the rupee though, the year has been one of a series of unfortunate events. Despite a strong economic growth and low inflation, the rupee declined to hit all-time lows and smash through critical psychological floors. Tariffs ate into exports, H1B visa tightening is threatening the Indian dream of making it big abroad and foreign investors aren’t interested in rupee assets beyond mere lip service. Dollars have persistently flown out and the Reserve Bank of India has had to make good this loss by being the biggest dollar seller in the market for many months. Its actions this year may influence the central bank’s approach next year too as we explained in this piece. The RBI is not only the biggest trader in forex, but it would be a big buyer in the bond market too. The RBI has announced a fresh set of bond buying earlier this week. Our Chart of the Day highlights the fact that government bond purchases by the RBI under open market operations would be historically high in fiscal 2026. At the start of 2025, the RBI had indicated that it would leave markets alone unless there is high volatility which requires intervention. By the year end, global volatility has forced the hand of the central bank, making it become a regular presence in both forex and the bond market. As the year comes to a close, the RBI may have diluted its stance of low intervention, but it has largely achieved its objectives of financial stability, keeping inflation low and liquidity in surplus. That said, central bank intervention is not without costs and distortions and investors will have to watch for these in the new year. Some incomplete tasks remain. The Indian government is yet to successfully strike a trade deal with the US on tariffs. The RBI may have had tremendous success in keeping inflation low, but a lot of price stability is subject to vagaries of food supply. The banking sector is in the pink of its health, but credit growth is yet to meaningfully revive which is expected in the new year. Here, the stress that the microfinance sector witnessed this year has now come to pass. But will the sector show strength in 2026? Dinesh Unnikrishnan explains what awaits the microfinance sector in his piece here. Finally, for investors the challenge to choose assets that have a healthy balance of risk and return remains. 2025 was a year of uncertainty and the next year may not be very different.

373,Economy,Inside India’s big savings slowdown and rising debt culture,"December 29, 2025 / 13:34 IST","A few weeks ago, I met a young tech couple in Bengaluru. Both earn well, work long hours, and proudly showed me their new apartment. The building is still under construction, but EMIs are already rolling. Their home is filled with the latest gadgets and appliances, mostly bought on zero-cost EMI. They have a modest SIP in the background, a rising credit card bill, and a philosophy that reflects aspirational India: “Why wait when we can afford the lifestyle today!” Their parents, in a small town in West Bengal, live in a very different financial universe. They believe in saving through fixed deposits, recurring deposits, and gold before spending. For them, debt represents risk and moral discomfort, not convenience. What separates the two generations is more than financial preference—it is a cultural divide about security, aspiration, and adulthood. Increasingly, this divide is not merely generational; it is also social and structural. India’s growth story today is shaped as much by how people save and borrow as by how much they earn. Household finance is influencing class boundaries, gender dynamics, mobility patterns, and intergenerational relationships. A thinning financial cushion CRISIL’s Quickonomics data shows a sharp change. Household savings fell to 18.4 percent of GDP in FY23 from a pre-pandemic average of 20.1 percent. Household financial liabilities have climbed to 5.8 percent of GDP, pushing net financial savings to a low of 5.3 percent. The numbers reveal only part of the story. The deeper shift is cultural. Saving first and spending later was common sense because risks of illness, job loss, or crop failure were private. Families created their own safety nets. Today, the habit of waiting has weakened. Housing loans,  consumption credit, personal loans, and buy-now-pay-later products have fostered a new belief that access matters more than accumulation. For many households, this opens doors to comfort and mobility. For others, it exposes them to risk. When savings cushions shrink, the ability to handle shocks weakens. The new middle class may appear prosperous in daily life but often lives closer to financial fragility than it admits. A new mix of wealth Even as total savings weaken, their composition has changed. CRISIL notes households are shifting from traditional deposits to mutual funds, equities, pensions, and insurance. Real estate remains strong, and physical assets stand at nearly 12.9 percent of GDP. The psychological shift is more notable. Urban households are becoming comfortable with market-linked returns, willing to trade guaranteed interest for potentially higher gains. This marks the rise of a market-linked middle class that sees wealth as something that can grow through participation rather than accumulation of land or gold. CRISIL projects that financial savings in managed funds could rise from about 57 percent of GDP to nearly 74 percent by 2027. This will create households whose financial outcomes depend on market cycles. Some will benefit; others, particularly those without financial literacy or digital access, risk being left behind. Inequality is increasingly about access to the formal financial system, not just income. Demography meets financial behavior India’s demographic dividend previously boosted savings, but today, savings behavior depends on education, employment, and location. Urban households, especially dual-income families, borrow and invest very differently from rural ones. This shift affects family dynamics. Young professionals who invest formally rely less on extended family during emergencies. Women managing SIPs or personal credit gain confidence and bargaining power at home. Joint families are giving way to smaller, more financially independent units. Regional differences are becoming sharper. Urban, market-integrated families build financial assets faster. Rural households depending on traditional savings or informal loans struggle to keep pace. This creates a quiet divide between financially integrated households and those left outside the formal system. The EMI lifestyle and its hidden fragility A large part of India’s rising consumption is fueled by credit. EMIs now shape budgeting for many households, enabling lifestyles that previously required long waiting periods. But reliance on credit reduces financial flexibility. Once EMIs dominate monthly cash flow, savings often fall. A single disruption—job loss or medical emergency—can cause stress. India’s aspirational economy is advancing on credit but with limited shock absorption. This creates a quiet duality. Some households use credit strategically to move up consumption brackets. Others remain in a state of permanent leverage. Over time, this could form two different societies: one that grows through strategic borrowing, another stuck in a cycle of stress. A new social map Changes in saving and borrowing reshape more than financial portfolios. They alter social life foundations. Inheritance itself is changing—families now pass down portfolios instead of land or gold. These are easier to divide but more vulnerable to market swings. Financial literacy increasingly determines intergenerational gain or loss. Gender relations are shifting. Women who manage investments or credit assume more active roles in decisions about schooling, healthcare, and purchases. This creates more balanced households where choices are not dictated by traditional roles. Urban mobility is also transforming. With wealth mostly financial rather than physical, young people feel freer to move across cities for work. They are less tied to ancestral property and more tied to skills and financial capability. Identity becomes shaped more by professional networks than birthplace. Yet these gains are uneven. Financially literate households benefit, while those without market knowledge or digital access risk falling behind. Over time, this could harden into a structural division where upward mobility depends on income and access to formal finance. Financial change and social evolution India’s evolving savings landscape is not just a statistical trend—it is a social transformation. How households save, borrow, and invest is reshaping family relationships, gender roles, mobility, and class boundaries. A more confident, financially literate generation is emerging, but it also faces higher exposure to debt and market volatility. India’s challenge is to guide this transition to strengthen resilience. Better financial education, consumer protection, and regulation will be central to ensuring opportunity is widely shared. India’s social map is quietly being redrawn through everyday financial decisions. Whether it broadens access or deepens divides will shape the country’s social character in the years ahead.

377,Economy,From taxes to jobs to laws: How 2025 became India’s biggest reform year,"December 25, 2025 / 15:55 IST","The year 2025 emerged as a defining chapter in India’s reform journey, marked by sweeping policy changes aimed at simplifying governance, modernising laws and aligning economic growth with global ambition. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the government pushed through structural reforms across taxation, labour, trade, energy and regulation, signalling a decisive shift towards scale, clarity and long-term competitiveness. India’s economic momentum remained strong through the year, with GDP growth touching 8.2 per cent—outpacing global estimates. The expansion was underpinned by reforms spanning labour laws, GST, income tax, infrastructure, foreign investment and trade agreements, alongside a broad deregulation drive impacting both industry and small businesses. Labour Reforms: Placing workers at the core of India’s growth story 2025 marked the first full year in which India’s four Labour Codes began reshaping the employment landscape in a visible manner. By consolidating 29 central labour laws into four streamlined codes, the reforms aimed to provide regulatory clarity for employers while strengthening protections for workers. The new framework focused on fair wages, smoother industrial relations, expanded social security coverage and improved workplace safety. Officials said the reforms were designed to support a workforce of over 64 crore people, boost female labour participation and sustain employment growth as the economy expands. Next-generation GST reforms: A simpler, fairer, more transparent system India’s Goods and Services Tax (GST) structure underwent major simplification in 2025, transitioning to a two-slab system of 5 per cent and 18 per cent. The move was aimed at reducing disputes, easing compliance and improving transparency for households, MSMEs, farmers and labour-intensive sectors. Consumer sentiment reflected the impact, with record festive sales during Diwali and Navratri. SBI Research projected that despite rate rationalisation, GST revenues in FY26 would exceed budget estimates, reinforcing the government’s argument that a simpler tax regime can remain fiscally strong. Income Tax Revolution: Relief for the Middle Class One of the most significant changes in 2025 was the overhaul of personal income tax. Individuals earning up to Rs12 lakh annually were exempted from income tax, offering substantial relief to middle-class households. The government also replaced the Income-tax Act of 1961 with the new Income Tax Act, 2025, scrapping decades of amendments and complex provisions. The new law rationalised exemptions, reduced litigation and strengthened voluntary compliance, signalling a shift towards technology-driven tax administration. Maritime and Blue Economy Reforms Parliament passed five key maritime legislations during the Monsoon Session, modernising India’s shipping and port governance framework. The new laws replaced colonial-era Acts dating back to 1908 and 1925. The reforms aimed to reduce documentation, lower logistics costs, promote coastal shipping and strengthen maritime safety, positioning India to expand its blue economy and align with global maritime standards. The Great EoDB Reset: India unshackles its entrepreneurs through QCO reform Ease of Doing Business reforms gained momentum with a sweeping review of Quality Control Orders (QCOs). Mandatory compliance was removed for 76 product categories, while over 200 more were identified for deregulation, easing compliance pressure on MSMEs and exporters. Letting small companies think big The definition of “small companies” was expanded to include firms with turnovers of up to Rs 100 crore, allowing growing enterprises to scale without facing disproportionate regulatory burdens. A new definition for bigger MSME ambitions Effective April 1, 2025, the MSME classification thresholds were significantly raised to remove disincentives for expansion. Investment and turnover limits were increased across micro, small and medium enterprises, enabling firms to grow while retaining MSME benefits and government support. Significant reforms in FDI The government allowed 100 per cent foreign direct investment in the insurance sector, a move expected to attract global capital, enhance competition and improve customer services in India’s growing insurance market. Opening global markets for Indian manufacturers and MSMEs India strengthened its trade footprint through multiple agreements, including the India–UK CETA, India–Oman CEPA, and FTAs with New Zealand and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). The EFTA deal included a binding $100 billion investment commitment over 15 years. Negotiations also advanced with the European Union, Canada, Israel and the Gulf Cooperation Council, supported by a ₹25,000 crore export promotion scheme aimed at achieving the $1 trillion export target. Market Securities reform A landmark Securities Market Code Bill was introduced to unify India’s securities laws into a single framework, aimed at strengthening governance, reducing compliance burden and supporting technology-driven capital markets. Jan Vishwas: Ending the era of criminalisation Under the Jan Vishwas reforms, over 200 minor offences were decriminalised and hundreds of outdated laws repealed. With Jan Vishwas 3.0 on the anvil and similar reforms adopted by NDA-governed states, the initiative evolved into a nationwide movement to reduce regulatory fear for businesses. The new era For India’s nuclear journey Parliament passed the SHANTI Bill, replacing the Atomic Energy Act, 1962, and subsuming nuclear liability provisions into a unified framework. The law opened select civilian nuclear projects to private and foreign participation while retaining government control over strategic areas, enabling large-scale investment and technology infusion. A landmark in rural employment reform The Viksit Bharat–G RAM G Bill, 2025, enhanced rural employment guarantees from 100 to 125 days, linking work with village infrastructure creation. The reform aimed to transform rural employment into a driver of durable assets and higher incomes. India’s Legal Overhaul The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) came into full effect in January 2025, replacing the Indian Penal Code of 1860. The new law addressed modern challenges such as cybercrime, organised crime and economic offences, while formally recognising digital evidence, e-FIRs and mandated timelines for trials.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/economy/policy/from-taxes-to-jobs-to-laws-how-2025-became-india-s-biggest-reform-year-13742439.html
378,Economy,Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | America rewrites the H-1B rulebook. Indians will feel it first,"December 24, 2025 / 14:20 IST","Dear Reader, For years, the H-1B visa lottery was simple and oddly democratic. A fresh graduate earning, say $65,000 a year, had the same odds as a senior engineer earning twice that. Skill, salary and seniority were flattened into a random draw, even as demand far outstripped supply. It looks like that era is now coming to an end. From the FY2027 cap season, the United States is set to move to a wage-weighted H-1B lottery. The higher the offered wage, the better the odds of selection. It is fair to say this is one of the most consequential changes to the programme in decades, especially for Indians who dominate the H-1B landscape. The US will still issue 85,000 new H-1B visas every year--65,000 under the regular cap and 20,000 for those with a US master’s degree or higher. What changes is how those scarce slots are distributed when applications flood in, as they have for over a decade. Under the new framework, applications linked to the highest wage band--Level IV--will get four chances in the lottery. Level III gets three, Level II two, and Level I just one. Everyone still counts once toward the final quota, but probability now has a clear bias. Pay more, and your odds improve. For Indian professionals, this redraws the map. The traditional H-1B funnel--where large IT services firms brought in early-career engineers in bulk--becomes narrower. Entry-level roles, already under pressure from automation and onshore hiring, will find it harder to clear the cap. On the other hand, experienced engineers, niche specialists, senior architects and product leaders stand to benefit. The US government’s reasoning is blunt. A random lottery, it says, does not serve the purpose of a programme meant for “specialised skills”. Wage, while imperfect, is being used as a proxy for skill and economic value. There is also an unspoken political subtext. Wage-weighting helps address long-standing criticism that the H-1B programme depresses local wages or is used as a low-cost labour channel, taking away white-collar jobs from Americans. From Washington’s point of view, this is course correction, not overhaul. From India’s point of view, it is a structural shift. In fact, Indian IT firms have already been preparing for this moment. H-1B usage by Indian tech companies has fallen sharply over the past eight years, while US big tech has emerged as a top sponsor. The new rule accelerates that divergence. High-value product roles fit neatly into the wage-weighted logic. Large-scale body-shopping models do not. There is also a compliance sting in the tail. Employers will now need to declare wage levels, job codes and work locations at the registration stage itself, and back these up with documents later. USCIS will have greater powers to deny or revoke petitions if it detects wage or role manipulation. Here, the message is clear--gaming the system will carry real risk. The ongoing H1 B policy tightening has also survived its first legal test. This week, a US federal judge rejected a challenge by the US Chamber of Commerce to President Donald Trump’s proposed $100,000 fee on new H-1B visas, ruling that it falls within the president’s broad authority to regulate immigration. Logically, business groups had warned that such a steep fee would force companies, hospitals and universities to cut jobs and services, but the court was unconvinced. The ruling effectively clears the way for the administration to use pricing, alongside probability, as a tool to reshape the H-1B programme—making cost itself a filter for who gets access. All this is unfolding amid wider visa uncertainty. Longer interview timelines, expanded social media checks, and travel advisories from US tech giants have already made H-1B life more fragile. The redesigned lottery fits neatly into that broader direction--fewer visas wasted on what the US sees as low-value use cases, tighter scrutiny everywhere else. What has not changed is equally important. Lower-wage roles are not excluded. But the nudge is unmistakable. What does it mean for Indian professionals? The signal is sobering but not hopeless. The H-1B is no longer about getting in early. It is about getting better--deeper skills, higher responsibility, stronger pay. The ladder is still there. Just that the lower rungs have become harder to step on. Investing insights from our research team Yes Bank: Why is the excitement missing despite the SMBC deal?

379,Economy,New GDP series may see debt and investment situation update in FY28,"December 29, 2025 / 08:00 IST","India’s new GDP series, scheduled for release in February 2026, could undergo another revision in FY28 as the government evaluates whether findings from the upcoming Debt and Investment Survey can be incorporated, according to officials familiar with the matter. For now, the revised national accounts will continue to rely on 2019 survey weights, with officials noting that a further update could be done if post-pandemic shifts in household savings and investment behaviour turn out to be significant. “We will try to see how we can incorporate the results in the new series, given how instrumental this survey is in estimating the investment position of the household sector,” said a person aware of the developments. The benchmark cost of repair and maintenance of the dwellings could be updated as new results are made available, the person said. Survey timelines and base-year shift The revised GDP series—using 2022–23 as the new base year—will be released on February 27, 2026, replacing the current 2011–12 base. The All India Debt and Investment Survey is scheduled to run from July 2026 to June 2027, with results expected in the second half of 2027. Why household surveys matter Household debt and investment surveys play a crucial role in estimating gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), a key proxy for investment in the economy. Under the current framework, benchmark estimates for rural and urban residential buildings, non-residential buildings and other construction works are derived using data from the National Sample Survey (NSS) 70th round All India Debt and Investment Survey (AIDIS), 2013, along with ratios of repair and maintenance of dwellings. Between 2004–05 and 2011–12, ownership of dwellings—an important input in investment estimation—rose by 94 percent, underscoring why periodic updates to household asset data materially affect GDP calculations. In the 2011–12 GDP series, estimates for private moneylenders were also derived using the same AIDIS data, supplemented by Reserve Bank of India reports and the Survey of Unincorporated Sector Enterprises (SUSE). The SUSE has since become an annual survey, improving the frequency and granularity of data on informal enterprises. More household data in the pipeline Beyond investment surveys, the statistics ministry is also planning to roll out a household income survey in the coming year, alongside a situational assessment of agricultural households. These exercises are expected to further strengthen the data backbone used for national accounts and distributional analysis.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/new-gdp-series-may-see-debt-and-investment-situation-update-in-fy28-13745723.html
380,Economy,Exports likely to grow by 3% to USD 850 billion this fiscal: GTRI,"December 25, 2025 / 20:22 IST","India's goods and services exports are likely to grow by 3 per cent to USD 850 billion in 2025-26, think tank GTRI said on Thursday. In 2024-25, the overall exports touched USD 825 billion (USD 438 billion in merchandise and USD 387 billion in services). Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) said the country's exports in 2026 will face a far tougher global trade environment than it has seen in years. Rising protectionism in advanced economies, weakening global demand and new climate-linked trade barriers are colliding just as India is trying to scale up exports, it said. The result is an outlook marked less by expansion and more by the challenge of holding ground, GTRI founder Ajay Srivastava said. ""In FY26, goods exports are likely to stay broadly flat, squeezed by weak global demand and renewed US tariff pressure, while services exports may inch past USD 400 billion. That would lift total exports to roughly USD 850 billion,"" he said. The external environment is deteriorating fast, he said, adding that Europe presents a different, but equally costly, challenge. The European Union will activate its Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) on January 1, 2026, effectively imposing a carbon tax on imports. Even before payments begin, compliance and reporting requirements have already pushed India's steel exports to the EU down by about 24 per cent, he noted. ""From 2026, EU importers will price Indian goods inclusive of CBAM costs, with payments settled through certificate surrender in 2027,"" he added. GTRI suggested that the government urgently review the performance of its FTAs' sector by sector to ensure they are actually expanding exports, integrating Indian firms into global value chains, and delivering measurable trade gains rather than remaining under-utilised diplomatic trophies.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/exports-likely-to-grow-by-3-to-usd-850-billion-this-fiscal-gtri-13742534.html
381,Economy,"Trump tariffs on China, India, Cambodia to drive up US Christmas costs","December 24, 2025 / 14:09 IST","Christmas in the United States may weigh on the wallet a little more this year — and not just because of festive splurge. A Moneycontrol analysis shows that the three largest suppliers of Christmas merchandise account for over 90 percent of America's festive imports and face high tariffs. From tree ornaments, nativity figurines to plastic decorations and wooden collectibles, US' Christmas supply chain is overwhelmingly concentrated in Asia. China dominates most key product lines, commanding 85–88 percent of US imports across major Christmas categories. India, while far smaller in scale, remains the second-most important supplier, particularly in wooden and handcrafted segments. China’s in the lead The largest Christmas category — ornaments not made of glass or wood — highlights the imbalance. In 2024, the US imported $2.55 billion worth of these items, of which China accounted for $2.24 billion, or nearly 88 percent. India shipped about $44.3 million, ranking third after China and Cambodia, which exported $165 million worth of goods. A similar pattern plays out in plastic decorations, a segment worth $589.7 million. Chinese goods  accounted for more than $508 million. Where India stands out India’s strength lies in artisan and niche festive categories. In glass ornaments and wooden Christmas decorations, India consistently ranks among the top three suppliers, reflecting its foothold in handcrafted, higher-value festive products that cater to premium buyers. Highly concentrated supply chain Overall, the US Christmas import market is strikingly concentrated. The top five supplier countries account for nearly the entire market, led by China, followed by Cambodia and India. European Union nations and select Southeast Asian exporters occupy much smaller place. China’s dominance is not confined to the US. Across major global markets, including the European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada and Australia, Chinese festive products routinely command over 90 percent market share in several categories.

382,Economy,Moneycontrol Pro Weekender | A not-so-quick recipe for investing,"December 27, 2025 / 10:18 IST","While global stock markets are swelling up on the backs of humungous investments in AI, India is missing out much of the excitement for now. Of course, investments in data centres and related areas are happening, and we had even constructed a basket of stocks that could benefit from the build-out. India's stock market will, however, see more money being sunk into the consumer tech industry. Zepto's IPO, likely to hit the markets soon in early-2026, will keep investor focus sharp in these companies. Quick commerce promises to remain one of the hottest parts of our stock market in terms of investments and growth of the business. It's a success few other countries have been able to replicate at this scale. Eternal’s (Zomato) debut in 2021 turned investor attention to the sector first followed by Swiggy’s listing. Now Zepto’s listing will occupy the spotlight in the first quarter. Three of the biggest players in this market will be battling it out in public. After Swiggy’s recent QIP, they had between them Rs 40,000 crore of cash, as reported by Moneycontrol. While the mix of fresh issue and offer for sale in Zepto’s IPO will be known later, it’s fair to assume that a substantial part will be a fresh issue to raise cash for the business. Some news reports claimed on Friday that Zepto’s issue size has risen to $1.3 billion, from earlier reports of $500 million. If true, the mop-up could be Rs 11,700 crore which will swell the size of the kitty between the three. To this, add the funds being deployed by other private-held contenders in the quick or e-commerce game, and the total investment can be transformative for the sector. But what are these investments for? Some of it will go into setting up warehouses to service orders, or dark stores as they are called. Some money will also be required to fund working capital, as the assortment is widening, with categories that move slowly compared to FMCG blocking capital. Most of all, the companies spend money to fund their marketing expenses to acquire and retain customers and push sales. Expanding operations into more cities are also likely to be part of the plan. Some believe this will lead to a war for market share among these three market leaders that could leave them bruised. Investors may then wonder if the investing play is in determining who the winner will be. That may indeed be an outcome but need not be the main play here. Public listings make companies discard a winner-takes-it-all approach, which can lead to deep cuts in margins and erosion in net worth due to losses. The bigger play lies in taking share away from their main competitors, the traditional kirana traders and the organised retail stores. A recent Kantar Global study had pointed to how the traditional trade’s share of the FMCG channel had come down to 78 percent from 82 percent some years ago. There is significant headroom here for companies to take a higher share of the grocery market, apart from the newer categories such as electronics and general merchandise that they are eyeing. But what’s certain is that these companies are likely to face margin pressures, not only due to competition but also in their bid for aggressive growth. Both Eternal and Swiggy have seen their shares decline in the past six months. Zepto’s entry will make investors even more nervous. But here’s what our research team had to say in their deep-dive into consumer tech stocks on December 26, “Within the sector, Eternal offers the most balanced risk–reward ratio, combining high-frequency demand, improving profitability and reasonable valuation relative to its maturity. Swiggy follows as a credible medium-term compounding play, with earnings visibility improving as food delivery margins expand and quick commerce losses narrow.” While there are pockets such as consumer tech, defence, premium consumer discretionary that have narratives for investors to latch onto, the broad market outlook appears to be more dependent on macros. Geopolitical events, America’s changing approach to the rest of the world and its impact on decisions of foreign investors will sway much of the mood next year. What should matter to investors is the fate of corporate earnings growth. The consensus is that earnings growth will revive and if that optimistic scenario plays out, then a rising tide of earnings can lift several boats. Quick commerce too would be monitored for the same. For retail investors, it always pays to reassess investing goals and ensure a diversified asset allocation that fits them. 2025 has shown enough examples of how it is difficult to pin down winning asset classes at the start of the year, based on historical performance. Silver outdid gold and large caps outdid mid-caps and small caps in 2025. What’s possible is to be reasonably diversified, patient and discount lost opportunities as a necessary evil in investing. Even quick commerce requires patience, not hasty bets. Wish you a happy new year, from the team at Moneycontrol Pro!

383,Companies,"Metal stocks rise for 8th day as global prices soar, Hind Copper, SAIL shares jump up to 15%; what lies ahead?","December 29, 2025 / 10:50 IST","The shares of metal companies surged for the eighth consecutive session on December 29, with heavyweights like Hindustan Copper, SAIL, Tata Steel and others surging up to 15 percent. Analysts have decoded the reasons behind the recent surge in the stocks, and what lies ahead. The sharp rise in the metal stocks today pushed the Nifty Metal index up 1.5 percent to 10,967.75, as seen at 9.55 am on Monday. Earlier during the day, the index hit a fresh 52-week high of 10,983.20. The index has now gained around 5 percent in eight sessions of gains so far. Why are metal stocks rising? The sharp rise in the metal stocks has been supported by a favourable global macro setup rather than a single trigger, said Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS. ""Recent sessions saw Nifty Metal and key names like Hindustan Copper, Hindalco, Vedanta and SAIL push to fresh highs, aided by broad-based buying across ferrous and non-ferrous counters. Turnover has picked up, signalling institutional interest returning after a weak November,"" the analyst said. Fed rate cut hopes: The sharp rise in metal stocks comes on the back of rising metal prices, due to expectations of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in US in 2026, said Aditya Welekar, Senior Research Analyst - Metals, Axis Securities. ""The easing labor market in the U.S. provides the Fed with the opportunity to lower rates, which bodes well for the metals market,"" he said. China's policy support: A key driver has been China, where incremental policy support for infrastructure, power grids, renewable energy and urban redevelopment is improving demand visibility for steel, copper, aluminium and zinc, Dasani added. “While the property sector remains weak, state-led capex and industrial activity have stabilised, helping metal prices find a floor,” he said. Tight supply: Tight inventories across several base metals have further limited downside risk despite uneven global growth, said Dasani. Welekar from Axis Securities also noted that the supply side for both precious metals and base metals like copper and aluminum is constrained, while demand remains strong. ""The demand for silver and base metals is largely driven by the ongoing needs of electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy, and advancements in artificial intelligence (AI),"" he added. Softer US dollar: Another important tailwind has been the softer US dollar. ""With markets pricing in a gradual easing cycle in the US, the dollar index has eased from recent highs, supporting dollar-denominated commodities. Lower real yields have also improved the relative attractiveness of metals. On the supply side, mining disruptions, higher energy costs and stricter environmental norms have constrained fresh capacity additions, particularly in refined metals, just as demand from energy transition themes such as electric vehicles, power transmission and renewable infrastructure remains steady,"" said Dasani. Rally in commodity prices: The current rally in gold, silver, and copper reflects a tightening physical supply environment rather than just paper-market enthusiasm, said Charmi Shah, Business Head at Wealth1. ""Silver and copper have been running structural deficits for years. In silver, demand from solar, electronics, and EV supply chains has consistently outpaced mine supply, while inventories across major exchanges remain thin. Copper, central to electrification and energy transition themes, continues to face underinvestment in new mines, long gestation periods, and declining ore grades. These constraints are now becoming visible in pricing,"" she said. Gold's strength, meanwhile, is being reinforced by aggressive central bank accumulation across emerging markets, particularly as countries seek diversification away from fiat currencies and sovereign debt, Shah said, adding that China’s buying interest across gold, silver, and industrial metals has further amplified the rally, especially at a time when global supply chains remain fragile. Top metal gainers today: Hindustan Copper shares jumped around 7 percent to trade at Rs 508.05 apiece.  Earlier during the day, the stock jumped around 15 percent to hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 545.95 apiece. This comes as copper prices hit new all-time high levels. Copper hit a record high of $12,960 a ton earlier in the session on benchmark three month copper on the London Metal Exchange. Steel Authority of India (SAIL) shares followed, rising over 4 percent. Tata Steel, Vedanta and Jindal Steel & Power shares rose more than 2 percent each. Hindustan Zinc shares gained nearly 2 percent, while APL Apollo Tubes and JSW Steel shares gained more than 1 percent each. Welspun Corp and Hindalco Industries shares gained nearly 1 percent each, while National Aluminium (NALCO), NMDC and Adani Enterprises shares were trading in the green with marginal gains. What lies ahead? Looking ahead, momentum in metal stocks could sustain, though volatility cannot be ruled out, said Dasani. Global steel demand is projected to grow only modestly through 2030, but ex-China consumption and infrastructure spending in emerging markets should still underpin a gradual uptrend in volumes. In India, government capex and housing demand remain key tailwinds for steel makers, the analyst added. Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director at Vibhavangal Anukulakara said that metals are still vulnerable to changes in global demand, currency fluctuations and rate expectations. Hence the rise can go on, but there will be bouts of volatility and occasional pullbacks as markets digest macro data and look for global growth drivers, according to the analyst. For the near term, the trade looks supported as long as the dollar stays soft and the Fed leans dovish, but any abrupt US data surprise or fresh concerns around China’s exports could trigger sharp corrections, Dasani noted, adding that for investors, this is a classic cyclical rally: focus on balance-sheet strength and cost-efficient producers rather than chasing every spike.

He was in Pimpri-Chinchwad on Sunday to campaign for the January 15 elections. ""For the sake of the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation elections, the 'clock' and the 'tutari' (trumpet) have united. The parivar has come together,"" he said. Pawar urged party workers to work hard and refrain from making any controversial comments during rallies. ""We are the ones who work for development. We will edge out those who tried to put this municipal corporation in debt,"" he said. Meanwhile, talks between the two parties are underway for a tie-up for the Pune Municipal Corporation polls. Earlier in the day, the Pawar family was in Baramati, where industrialist Gautam Adani inaugurated the Sharadchandra Pawar Centre of Excellence in Artificial Intelligence. Elections to 29 municipal corporations across Maharashtra, including the Pimpri-Chinchwad and Pune civic bodies, will be held on January 15, and votes will be counted the next day. The last date for filing nominations is December 30. Ajit, who split his uncle Sharad Pawar's Nationalist Congress Party and joined hands with the BJP and Eknath Shinde's Shiv Sena in 2023, had rebelled after making his misgivings clear about his uncle's staying at the helm of the party despite his advancing age. Ajit, who had taken oath as Deputy Chief Minister thrice in four years, had repeatedly slammed his uncle, a four-time Chief Minister of the state. Once he had even questioned why his uncle should continue to lead the party at his age. ""In other parties, leaders retire after an age. In BJP, leaders retire at 75, when are you going to stop? You should also give new people a chance. If we make mistakes, tell us. Your age is 83, will you ever stop or not?

387,Companies,OPINION | Beyond Capital: Why India’s philanthropists must lead with trust,"December 24, 2025 / 13:02 IST","India’s philanthropic capital is growing steadily, yet much of the social sector remains bound to traditional approaches to funding. Most grants continue to be restrictive and project-based, constraining non-profits from building institutional strength or driving long-term, systemic change. What the data says According to a Bridgespan report (2023), 75% of Indian funders say they invest in strengthening NGOs' institutional growth, but 70% of NGOs report that most funders don't actually support these needs. About 83% of NGOs find it hard to get flexible funding for support functions outside core programs, though 68% of funders say their policies allow it. The variance reveals a clear disconnect between funder policies and on-ground NGO realities. Globally too, this was evident until recently. Before 2020, less than 20 per cent of all foundation giving came in the form of unrestricted grants, despite decades of advocacy from non-profits for more flexible support. Then came a defining moment in modern philanthropy: Mackenzie Scott’s $12.8 billion in largely unrestricted donations to over 1,600 organisations by 2022. These investments reshaped how organisations built resilience, freedom, and capacity for lasting impact. Why trust-based giving works A three-year study by the Centre for Effective Philanthropy found that organisations funded through Mackenzie Scott’s unrestricted giving reported stronger financial stability, deeper programmatic success, and healthier organisational cultures. Nearly 88 per cent said their capacity to achieve their mission had grown, and over 70 per cent used these funds to strengthen long-term financial stability because they were able to invest in leadership, governance, and systems - areas often overlooked in conventional grant models. Furthermore, social sector leaders vouch that when organisations feel trusted, their ambition grows, confidence strengthens, and the willingness to take on systemic challenges deepens. Partnering with funders to co-create lasting change Trust in philanthropy is not merely a moral stance - it is also a strategic imperative that unlocks the full potential of capital and delivers lasting impact. Strengthening NGOs by investing in their leadership, systems, and financial capacity builds institutions that are resilient, capable, and ready to drive meaningful change. Yet, perceived risk often holds funders back from embracing trust-based approaches. Shifting toward long-term, collaborative partnerships can change this dynamic - transforming funders from transactional grant makers into genuine co-creators of impact. This shift calls for moving beyond compliance-heavy frameworks, particularly within CSR, to focus on long-term transformation rather than short-term outputs. Examples such as EdelGive Foundation’s flexible funding partnerships and ISDM’s Philanthropy for Inclusive Development Initiative demonstrate how trust nurtures resilience, empowers communities, and redistributes decision-making power. Flexible funding drives sustainability Flexible funding allows to strengthen local leadership and build resilient systems that last beyond any single intervention. By trusting communities with adaptable resources, organisations like Swades Foundation have nurtured thousands of volunteers who drive on-ground problem-solving. This approach has helped transform over 250 villages in rural Maharashtra into Dream Villages - evidence of how flexible support fosters independent, self-sustaining progress. The SEWA example Long before this global shift, the Self-Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) demonstrated how patient, trust-based investment in grassroots leadership can create enduring change. Its community-led model continues to empower women across generations, proving that true transformation requires both time and flexibility. Donor fears around fund misuse, limited short-term results, and loss of control have shaped a funding mindset that remains largely ROI-driven (return on investment), short-term, and project-based, often with little focus on sustainability. This approach ultimately weakens the true potential of philanthropic capital. For philanthropy to create lasting impact, funders - whether family foundations, corporates, or institutions, must embrace vulnerability, transparency, and patience. Sustainable change is built not through cost-cutting or control, but through mutual respect and long-term partnership. The future of India’s social sector, and the vision of a developed and equitable nation, will depend less on how much capital is deployed and more on how much trust is placed in those driving change at the grassroots.

388,Companies,Resolution of RIL’s $247 million KG basin cost recovery dispute with GoI seen in New Year,"December 26, 2025 / 20:43 IST","Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), the operator of the KG-D6 oil block since 2000, is contesting a $247 claim by the government for additional profit petroleum from KG-D6 in an international arbitration. As this process enters its last leg, a resolution can be expected in 2026, according to industry sources familiar with the case. The long-running dispute arose after the government disallowed recovery of part of the costs already invested by an RIL-led consortium. The consortium, which also included the UK’s BP Plc and Canada’s Niko Resources, has built deepwater facilities in the KG-D6 block, a first-of-its-kind in India. Deepwater exploration and production involve considerable risk, and production sharing contracts (PSCs) under the New Exploration and Licensing Policy (NELP) explicitly allow recovery of costs, including those incurred for exploration, development, and production, according to the industry sources cited. The government receives its profit share as per the terms of the production sharing contract, in addition to royalties and taxes. The government also constantly oversees, approves, and audits every expenditure incurred by the contractor, in this case, the RIL-led consortium. ‘Disallowing’ Expenditure In this case, the dispute, now subject to arbitration, arose when the government sought to disallow part of the capital expenditure incurred when gas production turned out to be less than expected. The government’s move was contrary to both the terms of the PSC and international norms, according to the industry sources cited earlier. The move dismayed RIL, which has invested considerable risk capital. Besides being a double whammy for RIL, it is also seen as damaging for India’s attraction as an investment destination with stable policies, several industry sources said. The government’s actions were more surprising as under the PSC, a management committee is set up with two government representatives, who hold veto power over every decision. The contractor consortium cannot implement any decision or spend any money without prior approval of the management committee. The RIL-led consortium followed these processes in letter and spirit and secured all government approvals, as per the industry sources cited. Further, no provision of the Production Sharing Contract allows for such unilateral and post-facto disallowance of costs after they have been incurred, one of the sources said. No Investment by GoI Importantly,  the government had not invested anything to develop the reserves and, therefore, bore no financial risk. Nonetheless, the government has received a significant amount of profit petroleum, royalty, and taxes so far. Moreover, RIL was forced to sell the entire gas produced at significant discounts to prevailing market prices despite the PSC explicitly guaranteeing market-driven prices. This marks another violation of the PSC, an industry official said. However, because of the discount,  the country benefited from cheap gas, and the government reduced its fiscal deficit by providing subsidised gas for priority-sector buyers. RIL developed the KG-D6 block in record time, which to date is India’s most successful deepwater producing block. All other blocks in the KG basin around KGD6, developed by other operators, have performed worse than the D6 block. However,  the government hasn’t initiated similar cost recovery proceedings against other operators. Having approved the plans and the contractor having undertaken investments in good faith, the government's action disallowing cost vitiates the sanctity of the contract and will negatively impact the investment outlook, industry experts reiterate. This is particularly so,  given that India’s import dependence continues to grow, and the country requires more investment for energy atmanirbharta.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/resolution-of-ril-s-247-million-kg-basin-cost-recovery-dispute-with-goi-seen-in-new-year-13744486.html
389,Companies,"SFIO probes IndusInd Bank for Rs 1,960-crore accounting discrepancies","December 24, 2025 / 18:44 IST","White collar crime probe agency SFIO has started investigating IndusInd Bank for accounting lapses in the derivatives portfolio having financial implication of Rs 1,960 crore to the bank. ""We hereby inform that the bank has received a letter dated December 23, 2025, from SFIO, regarding an investigation into the affairs of IndusInd Bank Ltd under Section 212 of the Companies Act, 2013 seeking relevant information,” the bank said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday. Section 212 of the Companies Act, 2013, empowers the central government to assign complex corporate fraud investigations to the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO), allowing for investigation based on reports, special resolutions, public interest, or government requests, granting SFIO broad powers to probe financial misdeeds. The bank on December 18 had said the RBI Master Directions on Fraud Risk Management in Commercial Banks (including Regional Rural Banks) and All India Financial Institutions dated July 15, 2024, mandate that any fraud reported to the RBI involving an amount of Rs 1 crore and above shall also be reported to the SFIO under the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. Accordingly, the bank said, matters relating to accounting of internal derivative trades, certain unsubstantiated balances in ’other assets’ and ’other liabilities’ accounts of the bank and micro finance interest income/fee income were reported to SFIO on June 2, 2025. The external auditor had in April pointed out cumulative adverse accounting impact on profit & loss at Rs 1,959.98 crore as on March 31, 2025 due to accounting discrepancies in its derivatives portfolio. On April 15, IndusInd Bank disclosed the basis report of another external agency that accounting lapses in the derivative portfolio will have a negative impact of Rs 1,979 crore on its net worth. The bank has assessed an adverse impact (on a post-tax basis) of 2.27 per cent to its net worth as of December 2024 on account of discrepancies relating to derivative deals. The private sector lender reported last month accounting lapses in the derivative portfolio, estimated to have an adverse impact of approximately 2.35 per cent of the bank’s net worth as of December 2024.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/sfio-probes-indusind-bank-for-rs-1-960-crore-accounting-discrepancies-13741926.html

392,Companies,Coforge shares rise even as analysts say $2.35-bn deal to buy Encora 'bold' but earnings dilutive,"December 29, 2025 / 10:23 IST","The shares of Coforge rose more than 2 percent in the morning trading hours of December 29 after the IT firm said that it will acquire US-based engineering services company Encora in a $2.35-billion all-stock transaction. The shares of the IT firm rose to Rs 1,711 apiece in the early trading hours of Monday, snapping a three-session losing streak. This comes even as brokerages remain divergent about their views on the impact of the acquisition of the AI firm. Coforge to acquire US-based AI firm Encora: In an exchange filing released in the post market hours of December 26, Coforge said that the acquisition will be executed through a share swap, under which the company will issue 93.8 million equity shares at Rs 1,815.91 apiece, implying a non-cash consideration of about Rs 17,032 crore. Encora shareholders will hold about 21.25 percent of Coforge’s post-issue equity capital. ""Coforge's acquisition of Encora will create a $2.5 billion Tech Services powerhouse with both the scale and capability across AI-led engineering, Cloud, and Data services to drive enterprise-grade AI-solutions,"" a release by the company read after it concluded its board meeting. Earlier, Moneycontrol exclusively reported that Coforge is in advanced discussions to acquire Encora, potentially marking one of the largest transactions in the digital engineering space, citing sources. Here's what brokerages say: Macquarie remained bullish on the shares of the company, double-upgrading its rating to 'Outperform' from 'Underperform' and raising its target price to Rs 2,230 apiece. This implies an upside potential of over 33 percent from the stock's previous closing price. The international brokerage believes that the acquisition of Encora will improve Coforge's service portfolio, and view this deal as a positive in the long term as it can accelerate Coforge's revenue growth, according to CNBC-TV18. Macquarie now expects longer-term sustainable revenue growth to be 15-18 percent. Elara Capital downgraded Coforge shares to ‘Reduce’ from ‘Accumulate’, and lowered its target price for the stock to Rs 1,720 per share from Rs 2,120 per share. The latest target price implies an upside potential of nearly 3 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The domestic brokerage noted that the acquisition will possibly help Coforge address its gaps in the North American market. However, valuations at EV/sales of 3.9x appear expensive considering that Encora posted only 7-10 percent organic revenue growth in the past two years, lower than Coforge’s revenue growth, it added. “Historically (in FY21-25), Coforge had reported high teen revenue CAGR on account of stable management, strong order book and specialization in select verticals of BFS, Insurance and Travel. Encora’s organic revenue growth, on the other ha nd, was lower at 7-10%. Despite lower growth, COFORGE is acquiring Encora at 3.9X EV/sales and ~21x EV/EBITDA, in line with COFORGE ’s multiples, which appears expensive. So, we cut our target multiple for COFORGE from 39x to 34x to reflect higher valuation concern. Organically also, some costs for COFORGE witnessed an uptick in recent quarters, which may strain its margins, going ahead. Thus, we cut our earnings estimates by 7–8% for FY27E and FY28E, respectively,” it said. Motilal Oswal Financial Services noted that the scale of transaction is large, therefore execution remains critical. Integration, leadership retention, margin management post-integration, and amortization will be the key monitorables. It however said that the vertical mix, primarily hi-tech and healthcare, is a positive, especially given Coforge’s strategic intent to scale these segments. “We believe Coforge’s strong executable order book and resilient client spending across verticals bode well for its organic business. This acquisition expands Coforge’s presence in the Hi-Tech and Healthcare verticals, though we have not yet incorporated Encora's numbers into our valuation. We continue to view Coforge as a structurally strong mid-tier player well-placed to benefit from vendor consolidation/cost-takeout deals and digital transformation,” the domestic brokerage said, while reiterating its ‘Buy’ call on the stock and a target price of Rs 2,500 per share, implying an upside potential of 49 percent. JM Financial said that the valuation looks rich given Encora’s 7 – 10 percent growth profile, CNBC-TV18 reported. Morgan Stanley analysts called the deal a ""bold move"", but said that the price tag appears expensive and is likely to be dilutive to earnings. Coforge's preference share issue creates an overhang once the lock-in period ends, Morgan Stanley added, forecasting a 12–13 percent decline in the stock. DAM Capital analysts said deal to be EPS dilutive, especially since price paid is higher than the firm's current valuation.

393,Companies,OPINION | Balancing India's AI Ambitions: CCI's approach to competition and innovation,"December 23, 2025 / 10:36 IST","The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has recently released its comprehensive market study on artificial intelligence and competition, offering fresh insights into how AI is reshaping India's economic landscape. The study's findings are striking: 52% of user-industry respondents reported that AI integration substantially improved competitiveness in their markets, while the technology is being rapidly adopted across banking, healthcare, retail, and logistics. The timing of this release coincides with media reports around how the CCI is examining AI integration in office suites, making the study's recommendations particularly relevant for India's regulatory approach. What the study captures is a broader moment of technological change. Every few decades, a new technology revolutionises how we live and work. Today, that technology is AI, advancing with a speed and impact that eclipses past innovations, transforming tasks from drafting documents and analysing data to powering customer service and software development. The CCI's study recognises this reality, noting that AI integration represents a strategic shift that fosters adaptability, competitiveness, and efficiency across sectors. The question is how India can capture this opportunity without weighing it down with premature or heavy-handed regulation. Why AI integration is different As the CCI weighs questions around AI integration in products like office suites, it’s worth recalling that not all integrations are alike. In competition law, such cases often evoke concerns of “tying and bundling,” where access to one product is linked to another. But AI integration is not a classic tying case where two separate products are tied together, and differs in both purpose and effect. While some AI tools exist as standalone products, much of their value is realised through cross-functional use. From search engines, to healthcare diagnostics, and telecom services, AI is increasingly being woven into the fabric of everyday tools and services, enhancing core functionality. The evolution of phone cameras offers a useful analogy. Adding a camera to a phone might have once raised bundling questions. Today, consumers expect seamless integration, with all phones now having cameras. AI enhances this further by powering sharper images and optimisation that hardware alone cannot deliver. Similarly, embedding AI into office software reflects user preference for integrated, more capable tool. AI integration doesn’t just add features; it can intensify competition by making products more distinctive. The market remains dynamic, with new players like DeepSeek, Anthropic, Cohere and Mistral scaling quickly. This shows incumbents embedding AI don’t foreclose rivals, rather, they keep competition alive, giving consumers more choice. The Government’s approach to AI The Government has recognised AI’s importance, launching the Rs 10,300 crore IndiaAI Mission and supporting start-ups and infrastructure. To encourage innovation in such a dynamic and evolving field, India has consciously avoided blanket regulation and instead, sectoral regulators like the ICMR in healthcare and the RBI in fintech have issued guidance. This light-touch approach gives AI room to grow, while keeping open the option of intervention if specific risks emerge. How the CCI has approached tech integration The CCI has been an active voice in this debate. The Chairperson, Ravneet Kaur, has repeatedly stressed the value of voluntary codes of conduct over coercive action and highlighted that traditional adversarial models of enforcement may not be suited to evolving markets. CCI’s AI market study, too, recommends that businesses adopt a self-audit framework to proactively detect and mitigate competition risks, rather than inviting premature enforcement, and gives guidelines on how to implement this. The Commission’s past decisions are equally instructive. In 2020, it found that integrating Google Meet with Gmail was not coercive and enhanced user experience. In reviewing WhatsApp Pay, it noted that users could freely adopt or ignore the feature, with rival apps still available. Most recently, in its March 2025 decision involving Microsoft’s pre-installed Defender antivirus software, the CCI dismissed a complaint alleging abusive bundling. It found no restriction on consumer choice or competition, noting that users can install third-party solutions and established rivals remain active in the market. The CCI has shown similar restraint in nascent markets: in 2019, when examining OYO in budget hotel franchising, it found that while OYO was significant, the market was still evolving and dominance could not be unambiguously concluded.  Together, these cases highlight a core principle: competition law is guided by consumer benefit, and integration that expands functionality without limiting choice meets that test. This is also why probes launched without a clear theory of harm risk creating uncertainty. Smart guardrails, not heavy hands As India shapes its AI future, competition oversight must balance two goals: consumer welfare and safeguarding innovation. The CCI’s AI market study finds that AI adoption has enhanced consumer welfare by improving service quality, personalisation, and access, and by expanding consumer choice through new and customised offerings The risk of regulating too early is that consumers end up paying more, while innovation slows, derailing India’s AI growth story. Heavy compliance costs, whether for legal reviews, audits, or product redesigns, seldom stay with companies; they trickle down to users. In a price-sensitive market like India, even small increases matter. Affordable options have helped drive adoption so far, from OpenAI’s discounted monthly plan to Airtel’s tie-up with Perplexity.ai that gives millions of users premium access worth nearly INR 17,000 annually. Heavy-handed rules could put such models at risk. The impact would not stop with big technological companies - it’s not just the big players at stake. Startups and small businesses often plug into the infrastructure of larger providers for APIs, compute and distribution. The CCI’s AI market study also notes that Indian startups are now integral to different layers of India’s AI stack, from data services (like Extracto, ML Labs, and iMerit) to model development and generative AI (such as Sarvam AI and Krutrim). Over-regulation in such a dynamic, interdependent ecosystem could disrupt this layered growth and limit India’s ability to scale its own AI capabilities. What markets need most is predictability. The CCI can provide it by offering practical guidance on how competition law will apply to AI integrations and emerging business models. With the industry still in its early stages, guidance, like the CCI’s combination FAQs, would give firms clarity on compliance and self-governance, rather than leaving them to learn through enforcement. Other jurisdictions, like Singapore, are already doing so. Ultimately, India’s AI ambition will depend less on sweeping probes and more on smart, measured guardrails that protect consumers while letting innovation thrive.

395,Companies,"Two new airlines get green light, but can they break India’s aviation duopoly?","December 24, 2025 / 21:25 IST","India’s aviation sector is set to see fresh entrants, with two new airlines, Al Hind Air and FlyExpress, receiving no objection certificates (NOCs) from the civil aviation ministry. Another carrier, Uttar Pradesh-based Shankh Air, which already has regulatory clearance, is expected to begin operations in 2026. While the government has signalled its intent to encourage more players in one of the world’s fastest-growing domestic aviation markets, industry experts caution that these additions alone may not be enough to fundamentally alter the sector’s structure. Al Hind Air is being promoted by the Kerala-based Alhind Group, while FlyExpress is positioned as a regional operator. Civil Aviation Minister K Rammohan Naidu welcomed the developments, saying on X, “Over the last week, I was pleased to have met teams from new airlines aspiring to take wings in Indian skies—Shankh Air, Al Hind Air and FlyExpress. While Shankh Air has already got the NOC from the Ministry, Al Hind Air and FlyExpress have received their NOCs this week.” Aviation expert, lawyer and Avialaz Consultants CEO Sanjay Lazar described the approvals as a positive but preliminary step. “It’s a much-needed development; however, it’s only the first step in a long chain of steps to be taken,” he said. Pointing to the challenges ahead, Lazar added, “Most often promoters run out of breath by the time they get to starting up with aircraft & crew.” He also flagged structural issues, saying, “The aviation structure in India is such that it is unwelcoming in red tape and in cost structures.” Lazar argued that the impact of these new entrants on the broader market may be limited. “Most of these new applicants are regional operators apart from Shank Air and thus don’t impact the overall market share of the giants,” he said, adding that “to change India’s aviation landscape will require at least 2 more national players and 2 more regional players in addition to those who have applied.” Currently, there are nine operational scheduled domestic carriers in the country. Regional airline Fly Big suspended its scheduled flights in October, underscoring the fragile economics of smaller operators. Market concentration remains high, with IndiGo and the Air India Group, comprising Air India and Air India Express, together controlling over 90 per cent of the domestic market. Concerns over an apparent duopoly have intensified in recent weeks following widespread operational disruptions at IndiGo, which alone commands more than 65 per cent market share. The episode renewed debate on whether India’s fast-expanding aviation market has enough competitive depth to absorb shocks. Apart from Air India, Air India Express, IndiGo and state-owned Alliance Air, other scheduled carriers include Akasa Air, SpiceJet, Star Air, Fly91 and IndiaOne Air, according to the latest Directorate General of Civil Aviation data. The sector has also seen high-profile exits in recent years, with airlines such as Go First and Jet Airways ceasing operations amid mounting debt. As new airlines line up for take-off, the developments signal renewed interest and policy support—but analysts say meaningful change in India’s aviation landscape will depend on whether these entrants can scale up sustainably in a market still dominated by a few large players.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/two-new-airlines-get-green-light-but-can-they-break-india-s-aviation-duopoly-13742013.html

403,Companies,From boAt to Zepto: Over 20 new-age firms gear up for 2026 IPOs as late-stage funding shrinks,"December 23, 2025 / 09:35 IST","India’s startup markets are heading into 2026 with a packed initial public offering (IPO) queue, as more than 20 new-age firms prepare to hit Dalal Street next year. The roster spans sectors like fintech, ecommerce, logistics, consumer brands and B2B marketplaces, pointing to another year of broad-based issuance after a landmark 2025. The cohort features some of India’s most recognisable private-market names. PhonePe, Flipkart, Zepto, boAt, Shiprocket, Infra.Market, OfBusiness and Shadowfax are among the firms looking to tap the public markets — a line-up that suggests demand is broad-based rather than sector-specific.  Why is the 2026 IPO pipeline swelling? This build-up comes as late-stage private capital remains constrained and more scaled companies are considering public markets as their most realistic route for funding, liquidity and valuation discovery. “When you have no late-stage private funding, that’s when people go IPO. The private markets are far more forgiving than public markets… When that tap tightens, exits start happening in the public markets,” said Deepak Shenoy, founder of Capitalmind. Late-stage funding among Indian startups declined by almost eight percent year-on-year to $7.39 billion across 371 deals in 2025, from $8 billion across 412 deals the previous year, according to Venture Intelligence — a drop that accelerated the IPO push in 2025 and is now shaping plans for 2026. What’s driving confidence among companies looking to list? India’s public markets have absorbed new-age IPOs far more consistently than the 2021–22 cycle. Companies that listed in 2025 did so at stronger profitability levels, cleaner unit economics and tighter cost structures, Moneycontrol reported earlier. As per a Moneycontrol analysis, 15 new-age IPOs raised close to Rs 40,000 crore in 2025, more than 35 percent higher than the Rs 29,000 crore raised across 13 listings in 2024. Crucially, the capital raised was split almost evenly between fresh issues and offer-for-sale (OFS) blocks — allowing companies to fund expansion while also giving early investors and founders meaningful liquidity. What sectors dominate the 2026 queue? Fintech, ecommerce and logistics firms form the bulk of the pipeline. PhonePe, PayU, Shiprocket, Shadowfax, InCred, Aye Finance and Turtlemint are expected to drive activity. Consumer and brand-led platforms — boAt, Curefoods and Zepto — are also positioned to draw significant interest, while B2B heavyweights such as Infra.Market, OfBusiness, Captain Fresh, Fractal and Zetwork point to rising public-market appetite for enterprise tech and supply-chain platforms. Analysts at Bajaj Broking Research said the breadth of the pipeline reflects a structural shift rather than a one-off response to liquidity conditions. “2025 marks the start of a more sustained IPO cycle for new-age companies, supported by deeper domestic participation and a growing pool of mature startups,” they noted. Why are founders turning to public markets earlier? For many founders and investors, IPOs are increasingly being considered earlier in the company lifecycle — not as a distress outcome, but as a strategic choice. “When we started investing in India aggressively in 2017, 2018, there was no company which had done an IPO. But now… I think today we are competing actually against the IPO market as well,” Sumer Juneja, Managing Partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, told Moneycontrol earlier, adding that public-market capital has been “phenomenal for the ecosystem”. As private valuations compress and late-stage capital becomes more selective, public markets are emerging as the primary arena for large-scale capital formation and exits. What does the growing pipeline signal? After a year in which new-age firms raised close to Rs 40,000 crore through public listings, the expanding 2026 pipeline signals that IPOs are becoming a structural feature of India’s startup lifecycle. Rather than a cyclical funding workaround, public markets are increasingly where scale-stage companies are choosing to grow, exit and reset valuations.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/from-boat-to-zepto-over-20-new-age-firms-gear-up-for-2026-ipos-as-late-stage-funding-shrinks-13738537.html

405,Companies,"From Starlink to OneWeb: What’s holding back India’s satellite internet launch; Scindia flags security, pricing","December 28, 2025 / 17:38 IST","Satellite communication services will be rolled out in the country after players in the segment, including Elon Musk-owned Starlink, comply with the demands of security agencies, Union Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said. The minister, in an interview to PTI, said the government will soon be in a position to allocate spectrum to satcom players - Starlink, Eutelsat One, and Jio SGS - once Department of Telecom (DoT) finalises spectrum pricing. ""There are two issues that need to be addressed. One by the licence holders OneWeb, Reliance Jio, and Starlink, which is to comply with security clearances regarding international gateways, ensuring data remains in India, and so on,"" Scindia said. The minister added that the government has already allocated provisional spectrum to satcom companies to demonstrate compliance capability with security agencies. ""They are in the process of doing that, so they need to comply,"" Scindia said. He noted that the government is in the process of finalising spectrum pricing, which is being dealt with by DoT and the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai). ""Hopefully that should be resolved soon,"" Scindia said. Trai and DoT have differences on several points over spectrum for satcom services. Earlier this month, Trai rejected several suggestions made by the DoT on spectrum allocation for satcom services, including levying a 5 per cent annual spectrum fee on satellite communication players instead of 4 per cent, and scrapping a Rs 500 fee per connection in urban areas, among other points. DoT is expected to give its presentation before the apex decision-making body in the telecom sector, the Digital Communication Commission (DCC). The DCC will decide on the future course of action on spectrum pricing, which may include seeking Cabinet approval on the final decision. Talking about relief sought by Vodafone Idea (VIL), the minister said the DoT is still working on it. ""We are today applying our minds on that. It is work in progress within the Department of Telecommunications,"" Scindia said. VIL, in a letter to the DoT earlier this year, said its liabilities to the government are to the tune of around Rs 2 lakh crore, which includes Rs 1.19 lakh crore towards spectrum dues. The company said that in case of no support, the Centre will face significant direct monetary loss with no recovery of spectrum dues, equity value of Rs 53,083 crore becoming nil, and no recovery of AGR dues. The Supreme Court has given the government an option to resolve the issue within the ambit of its policy-making powers. When asked about the sustainability of repeated relief to VIL, the minister said no relief has been given to the company so far. ""We have not given any relief as such. We have converted our dues into equity. Therefore, we hold a 49 per cent equity stake in Vodafone against dues of close to, if I recall correctly, Rs 37,000 crore. That is now the Government of India's equity stake in that company,"" Scindia said. In the absence of any relief, VIL needs to pay around Rs 18,000 crore by March 2026, and a similar amount every year for the next six years. The annual liabilities on VIL are more than double its annual operational cash generation, which has been in the range of Rs 8,400-9,200 crore for the last three years. VIL has said the market will slip into a duopoly and there will be a significant hike in telecom service prices if its operations come under threat. Scindia said the Indian market continues to be robust with four operators and the government would like to maintain that. ""If you look at countries across the world, very few can boast of four providers of telecom services. India today has four very robust telcos,"" the minister said. He added that even players such as Vodafone Idea and BSNL currently serve close to about 210 million and 100 million customers,respectively. ""Very few telcos in the world can boast of that. You have an economy with four players, very robust pricing, and high economies of scale in the market. We would like to see that continue,"" Scindia said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/from-starlink-to-oneweb-what-s-holding-back-india-s-satellite-internet-launch-scindia-flags-security-pricing-13745583.html

412,Companies,IndiGo flight disruptions: Panel submits probe report to DGCA,"December 26, 2025 / 22:28 IST","The four-member panel that probed the massive flight disruptions at IndiGo earlier this week has submitted its report to the aviation regulator DGCA, according to a senior official. The inquiry committee, headed by DGCA Joint Director General Sanjay K Bramhane, was constituted on December 5 to conduct a comprehensive review and assessment of the circumstances that led to the massive flight disruptions. The official said the committee has submitted its report on Friday evening. A source said copies of the report have been shared with the office of Civil Aviation Minister K Rammohan Naidu and Civil Aviation Secretary Samir Kumar Sinha. Details about the report could not be immediately ascertained. Other members in the Brahmane-led panel were DGCA’s Deputy Director General Amit Gupta, Senior Flight Operations Inspector Captain Kapil Manglik and Flight Operations Inspector Captain Rampal. Earlier this month, IndiGo cancelled more than 1,600 flights in a single day, and inadequate planning in implementing the revised pilot rest norms was a key reason for the disruptions. Following the disruptions, DGCA directed IndiGo, the country’s largest airline, to reduce its winter schedule by 10 per cent and issued show-cause notices to the airline’s CEO, Pieter Elbers, and COO, Isidre Porqueras. In the order dated December 5 on setting up the panel, it said that, prima facie, the situation indicates deficiencies in internal oversight, operational preparedness, and compliance planning, ”warranting an independent examination”. As per that DGCA (Directorate General of Civil Aviation) order, the regulator had issued repeated directions and advance instructions from time to time to the airline on timely preparation to implement the provisions related to the FDTL (Flight Duty Time Limitations) norms. The regulator had also observed the airline’s inability to accurately forecast crew availability, conduct timely training, and realign rosters despite advance regulatory intimation, resulting in cascading delays and cancellations across its network beginning late November 2025 and leading to non-adherence to the directions. Subsequently, the watchdog held a review meeting with IndiGo, wherein the airline acknowledged that it had failed to anticipate the actual crew requirement under the revised norms and that significant planning and assessment gaps existed in implementing Phase-II of FDTL CAR 2024, as per the order. The Civil Aviation Requirements (CAR) pertaining to FDTL were implemented in two phases — the first phase came into force from July 1, and the second from November 1. ”This shortfall directly contributed to large-scale disruptions, with cancellations reaching 170-200 flights daily, severely affecting network integrity and passenger convenience. Where it was noticed in the month of November, the flight cancellations of IndiGo were maximum vis-a-vis other airlines,” the order had said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/indigo-flight-disruptions-panel-submits-probe-report-to-dgca-13744543.html

In an interview with PTI, JB Park, President and CEO of Samsung Southwest Asia, said the South Korean electronics major has no immediate plans to tap the Indian capital markets. When asked about a possible IPO, Park said, “No, we do not have any such plans as of now.” Samsung, which operates its largest smartphone manufacturing facility in the world at Noida, is instead looking to deepen its manufacturing footprint in India. Park said the company has applied under the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for components to manufacture mobile phone displays locally, underscoring India’s role as both a major domestic market and an export hub. While South Korean peers such as Hyundai Motor India and LG Electronics have recently accessed public markets, Samsung prefers to fund its expansion internally. Park said the company has several alternatives to raise capital if needed. “So, there are multiple options that you can get the working capital in place. So, IPO is not the plan for Samsung,” he said. A key growth driver for Samsung in India is its consumer finance arm, Finance+. The company currently offers interest-free EMIs on smartphones and is expanding the scheme to home appliances such as televisions and washing machines. “More than 40 per cent of smartphones have been sold on Finance+,” Park said, adding that the segment is growing at around 10 per cent every year and is particularly important for expanding sales in rural markets across north and northeast India. AI, Park said, will be central to Samsung’s future product strategy. The company plans to showcase several AI-powered innovations at CES 2026 in Las Vegas next month. “AI appliances are entering a new turning point,” he said, with products offering smarter and more personalised user experiences. At CES, Samsung is expected to unveil upgrades across its AI appliance lineup, including washing solutions, air conditioners, robot vacuums, and refrigerators. The company will also introduce enhancements to its premium TV portfolio, including the next generation of Micro RGB display technology. Highlighting India’s role in Samsung’s global innovation strategy, Park said the company employs over 10,000 engineers across three R&D centres and a design centre in the country, contributing to both India-specific and global product development. *With PTI Inputs",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/no-india-ipo-for-now-samsung-bets-on-ai-local-manufacturing-and-easy-finance-to-drive-growth-13742424.html
415,Companies,"Robin Raina denies Eraaya Lifespaces’ claims, says legal fight on for rightful 50% shareholding","December 23, 2025 / 18:53 IST","Robin Raina, former chairman and CEO of Ebix, Inc., has issued a clarification rejecting what he described as a “false and misleading narrative” being circulated by Eraaya Lifespaces Limited through repeated media statements. In a press note released on Tuesday, Raina said Eraaya has been misrepresenting a Supreme Court order to suggest that the court has ruled against him on the merits of his ownership and contractual claims. He said no such finding exists and that the claims being made by Eraaya are “legally untenable”. The clarification follows statements by Eraaya regarding an order passed by the Supreme Court on August 25, 2024, in relation to Raina’s application under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. According to Raina, Eraaya has falsely claimed that the order brought “closure” to his ownership claims or that the court held agreements relied upon by him to be forged. Raina said the Supreme Court order was limited only to the issue of whether an immediate reference to arbitration was warranted at that stage. He pointed out that the court had expressly stated that it had not examined the merits of the dispute and that all issues between the parties were kept open. He added that the Supreme Court did not examine the validity of any agreement, did not record any finding of forgery, fraud or fabrication, and did not adjudicate upon his substantive rights, including his claim to a 50 percent shareholding in Eraaya and, by extension, Ebix. According to the statement, multiple legal proceedings initiated by Raina against Eraaya Lifespaces, Vikas Garg and entities controlled by him are currently pending before courts in Delhi and Noida. The press note also said several actions are underway in the United States, involving allegations of fraud, forgery, extortion, theft, wrongful termination, defamation and violations under RICO statutes, with additional proceedings being prepared. Raina said his claim to a 50 percent shareholding in Eraaya is based on binding agreements executed in August 2024 and will be adjudicated in accordance with law. He maintained that the Supreme Court order expressly preserves all his rights and remedies. The statement also accused Eraaya of attempting to mislead investors and the public, noting that the company’s own press releases in June 2024 had announced Raina’s appointment as chairman and praised his leadership, including the value creation achieved at Ebix. Raina said the current narrative contradicts those earlier public statements. Commenting on the issue, Raina said, “I categorically reject the false narrative being peddled by Eraaya through selective and misleading interpretations of court orders. The Hon’ble Supreme Court has not examined the merits of my claims, nor has it closed any issue. My legal rights remain fully intact, and I will pursue justice in India and internationally.” Raina is represented in India by S & K Chambers and in the United States by Stanton Law in connection with the ongoing and proposed proceedings. The press note said the clarification was issued in the interest of transparency and that Raina reserves the right to initiate legal action against what he described as defamatory and misleading publications.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/robin-raina-categorically-refutes-false-and-misleading-claims-by-eraaya-lifespaces-and-reaffirms-ongoing-legal-action-to-secure-his-rightful-50-shareholding-13739931.html

417,Tech,"Metal stocks rise for 8th day as global prices soar, Hind Copper, SAIL shares jump up to 15%; what lies ahead?","December 29, 2025 / 10:50 IST","The shares of metal companies surged for the eighth consecutive session on December 29, with heavyweights like Hindustan Copper, SAIL, Tata Steel and others surging up to 15 percent. Analysts have decoded the reasons behind the recent surge in the stocks, and what lies ahead. The sharp rise in the metal stocks today pushed the Nifty Metal index up 1.5 percent to 10,967.75, as seen at 9.55 am on Monday. Earlier during the day, the index hit a fresh 52-week high of 10,983.20. The index has now gained around 5 percent in eight sessions of gains so far. Why are metal stocks rising? The sharp rise in the metal stocks has been supported by a favourable global macro setup rather than a single trigger, said Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS. ""Recent sessions saw Nifty Metal and key names like Hindustan Copper, Hindalco, Vedanta and SAIL push to fresh highs, aided by broad-based buying across ferrous and non-ferrous counters. Turnover has picked up, signalling institutional interest returning after a weak November,"" the analyst said. Fed rate cut hopes: The sharp rise in metal stocks comes on the back of rising metal prices, due to expectations of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in US in 2026, said Aditya Welekar, Senior Research Analyst - Metals, Axis Securities. ""The easing labor market in the U.S. provides the Fed with the opportunity to lower rates, which bodes well for the metals market,"" he said. China's policy support: A key driver has been China, where incremental policy support for infrastructure, power grids, renewable energy and urban redevelopment is improving demand visibility for steel, copper, aluminium and zinc, Dasani added. “While the property sector remains weak, state-led capex and industrial activity have stabilised, helping metal prices find a floor,” he said. Tight supply: Tight inventories across several base metals have further limited downside risk despite uneven global growth, said Dasani. Welekar from Axis Securities also noted that the supply side for both precious metals and base metals like copper and aluminum is constrained, while demand remains strong. ""The demand for silver and base metals is largely driven by the ongoing needs of electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy, and advancements in artificial intelligence (AI),"" he added. Softer US dollar: Another important tailwind has been the softer US dollar. ""With markets pricing in a gradual easing cycle in the US, the dollar index has eased from recent highs, supporting dollar-denominated commodities. Lower real yields have also improved the relative attractiveness of metals. On the supply side, mining disruptions, higher energy costs and stricter environmental norms have constrained fresh capacity additions, particularly in refined metals, just as demand from energy transition themes such as electric vehicles, power transmission and renewable infrastructure remains steady,"" said Dasani. Rally in commodity prices: The current rally in gold, silver, and copper reflects a tightening physical supply environment rather than just paper-market enthusiasm, said Charmi Shah, Business Head at Wealth1. ""Silver and copper have been running structural deficits for years. In silver, demand from solar, electronics, and EV supply chains has consistently outpaced mine supply, while inventories across major exchanges remain thin. Copper, central to electrification and energy transition themes, continues to face underinvestment in new mines, long gestation periods, and declining ore grades. These constraints are now becoming visible in pricing,"" she said. Gold's strength, meanwhile, is being reinforced by aggressive central bank accumulation across emerging markets, particularly as countries seek diversification away from fiat currencies and sovereign debt, Shah said, adding that China’s buying interest across gold, silver, and industrial metals has further amplified the rally, especially at a time when global supply chains remain fragile. Top metal gainers today: Hindustan Copper shares jumped around 7 percent to trade at Rs 508.05 apiece.  Earlier during the day, the stock jumped around 15 percent to hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 545.95 apiece. This comes as copper prices hit new all-time high levels. Copper hit a record high of $12,960 a ton earlier in the session on benchmark three month copper on the London Metal Exchange. Steel Authority of India (SAIL) shares followed, rising over 4 percent. Tata Steel, Vedanta and Jindal Steel & Power shares rose more than 2 percent each. Hindustan Zinc shares gained nearly 2 percent, while APL Apollo Tubes and JSW Steel shares gained more than 1 percent each. Welspun Corp and Hindalco Industries shares gained nearly 1 percent each, while National Aluminium (NALCO), NMDC and Adani Enterprises shares were trading in the green with marginal gains. What lies ahead? Looking ahead, momentum in metal stocks could sustain, though volatility cannot be ruled out, said Dasani. Global steel demand is projected to grow only modestly through 2030, but ex-China consumption and infrastructure spending in emerging markets should still underpin a gradual uptrend in volumes. In India, government capex and housing demand remain key tailwinds for steel makers, the analyst added. Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director at Vibhavangal Anukulakara said that metals are still vulnerable to changes in global demand, currency fluctuations and rate expectations. Hence the rise can go on, but there will be bouts of volatility and occasional pullbacks as markets digest macro data and look for global growth drivers, according to the analyst. For the near term, the trade looks supported as long as the dollar stays soft and the Fed leans dovish, but any abrupt US data surprise or fresh concerns around China’s exports could trigger sharp corrections, Dasani noted, adding that for investors, this is a classic cyclical rally: focus on balance-sheet strength and cost-efficient producers rather than chasing every spike.

""For the sake of the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation elections, the 'clock' and the 'tutari' (trumpet) have united. The parivar has come together,"" he said.

428,Tech,Coforge shares rise even as analysts say $2.35-bn deal to buy Encora 'bold' but earnings dilutive,"December 29, 2025 / 10:23 IST","The shares of Coforge rose more than 2 percent in the morning trading hours of December 29 after the IT firm said that it will acquire US-based engineering services company Encora in a $2.35-billion all-stock transaction. The shares of the IT firm rose to Rs 1,711 apiece in the early trading hours of Monday, snapping a three-session losing streak. This comes even as brokerages remain divergent about their views on the impact of the acquisition of the AI firm. Coforge to acquire US-based AI firm Encora: In an exchange filing released in the post market hours of December 26, Coforge said that the acquisition will be executed through a share swap, under which the company will issue 93.8 million equity shares at Rs 1,815.91 apiece, implying a non-cash consideration of about Rs 17,032 crore. Encora shareholders will hold about 21.25 percent of Coforge’s post-issue equity capital. ""Coforge's acquisition of Encora will create a $2.5 billion Tech Services powerhouse with both the scale and capability across AI-led engineering, Cloud, and Data services to drive enterprise-grade AI-solutions,"" a release by the company read after it concluded its board meeting. Earlier, Moneycontrol exclusively reported that Coforge is in advanced discussions to acquire Encora, potentially marking one of the largest transactions in the digital engineering space, citing sources. Here's what brokerages say: Macquarie remained bullish on the shares of the company, double-upgrading its rating to 'Outperform' from 'Underperform' and raising its target price to Rs 2,230 apiece. This implies an upside potential of over 33 percent from the stock's previous closing price. The international brokerage believes that the acquisition of Encora will improve Coforge's service portfolio, and view this deal as a positive in the long term as it can accelerate Coforge's revenue growth, according to CNBC-TV18. Macquarie now expects longer-term sustainable revenue growth to be 15-18 percent. Elara Capital downgraded Coforge shares to ‘Reduce’ from ‘Accumulate’, and lowered its target price for the stock to Rs 1,720 per share from Rs 2,120 per share. The latest target price implies an upside potential of nearly 3 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The domestic brokerage noted that the acquisition will possibly help Coforge address its gaps in the North American market. However, valuations at EV/sales of 3.9x appear expensive considering that Encora posted only 7-10 percent organic revenue growth in the past two years, lower than Coforge’s revenue growth, it added. “Historically (in FY21-25), Coforge had reported high teen revenue CAGR on account of stable management, strong order book and specialization in select verticals of BFS, Insurance and Travel. Encora’s organic revenue growth, on the other ha nd, was lower at 7-10%. Despite lower growth, COFORGE is acquiring Encora at 3.9X EV/sales and ~21x EV/EBITDA, in line with COFORGE ’s multiples, which appears expensive. So, we cut our target multiple for COFORGE from 39x to 34x to reflect higher valuation concern. Organically also, some costs for COFORGE witnessed an uptick in recent quarters, which may strain its margins, going ahead. Thus, we cut our earnings estimates by 7–8% for FY27E and FY28E, respectively,” it said. Motilal Oswal Financial Services noted that the scale of transaction is large, therefore execution remains critical. Integration, leadership retention, margin management post-integration, and amortization will be the key monitorables. It however said that the vertical mix, primarily hi-tech and healthcare, is a positive, especially given Coforge’s strategic intent to scale these segments. “We believe Coforge’s strong executable order book and resilient client spending across verticals bode well for its organic business. This acquisition expands Coforge’s presence in the Hi-Tech and Healthcare verticals, though we have not yet incorporated Encora's numbers into our valuation. We continue to view Coforge as a structurally strong mid-tier player well-placed to benefit from vendor consolidation/cost-takeout deals and digital transformation,” the domestic brokerage said, while reiterating its ‘Buy’ call on the stock and a target price of Rs 2,500 per share, implying an upside potential of 49 percent. JM Financial said that the valuation looks rich given Encora’s 7 – 10 percent growth profile, CNBC-TV18 reported. Morgan Stanley analysts called the deal a ""bold move"", but said that the price tag appears expensive and is likely to be dilutive to earnings. Coforge's preference share issue creates an overhang once the lock-in period ends, Morgan Stanley added, forecasting a 12–13 percent decline in the stock. DAM Capital analysts said deal to be EPS dilutive, especially since price paid is higher than the firm's current valuation.

The spot price of silver hit an all-time high at $82.95 an ounce on December 29 (4:45 am IST), and fell briefly to $80.40 (9:05 am), up 1.55 per cent in a day and 16.38 per cent in a week.

Why are silver prices rising? According to the Augmont Bullion report published on December 24, the spot price of silver has increased by more than 140 per cent, setting new records. ""Silver may consolidate but remains structurally bullish, with many models projecting $65-$80+ through 2026 as tight supply and industrial demand persist,"" said Justin Khoo, Senior Market Analyst - APAC, VT Market Check out below to see the prices of 1 kilogram of 999 purity silver. Source: Indian Bullion Jewellers Association – 18:30 rate session as on Dec. 26. City-wise silver prices in India Today Silver rates across India’s major cities showed remarkable uniformity, with only marginal differences due to local taxes, jeweller margins, and logistics costs. Source: Goodreturns Outlook: Will silver regain momentum this week? Justin Khoo predicts that in the near term, silver is vulnerable to tactical profit booking as prices have rallied sharply and are trading well above medium-term averages, which typically invites consolidation. ""Silver’s higher beta versus gold means corrections tend to be faster and deeper. However, any pullback should be viewed as corrective rather than trend-ending, especially while concerns about inflation, fiscal stress, and real-rate uncertainty remain supportive of precious metals. ""The sharp compression in the gold-silver ratio signals relative exhaustion in silver’s outperformance, not a reversal for the metals complex. Historically, such moves are followed by phases where gold stabilises, and silver corrects. This points to rotation within precious metals, not a breakdown,"" said Justin Khoo.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/silver-price-today-futures-hit-all-time-high-of-rs-2-53-lakh-kg-on-mcx-spot-price-near-83-check-rates-in-your-city-13745998.html
