The O

The O

also O
flagged O
shortcomings O
in O
passenger O

that O
IndiGo O

not O

in O

So O
I O

that O

changed O

quite O
a O
bit. O

In O

such O

Kotak B-ORG

and O
others. O

The O
central O
question, O
according O
to O
Pettit, O
is O
whether O
these O
cuts O
will O
be O
accompanied O
by O
economic O
weakness O
or O
if O
the O
US B-TICKER
economy O
will O
remain O
resilient. O

While O
the O
upturn O
may O
be O
relatively O
shallow, O
we O
do O
expect O
a O
recovery O
to O
continue, O
with O
the O
last O
quarter O
of O
the O
current O
fiscal O
also O
shaping O
up O
to O
be O
supportive O
for O
the O
segment. O

From O
a O
long-term O
perspective, O
rising O
government O
interest O
burdens O
strengthen O
gold’s O
role O
as O
a O
reliable O
store O
of O

and O
a O
hedge O
against O
fiscal O
and O

uncertainty. O

Globally, O
the O

all O

will O
look O

current O

The O

that O

not O

Shah O

no O

forecast O
that O

that O

firmly O

Hence, O
the O
final O
decision O
ultimately O
lies O
with O

AI-based B-TICKER

facilitate O
more O

For O
example, O
in O
the O

40% B-PERCENT

it, O
Vietnam O
would O
not O
impose O
any O
tariffs O
on O
its O
imports O
of O
American O

We O
expect O
a O
gradual O
